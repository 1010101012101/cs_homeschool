You will need Node 6.5.0 or newer.

To verify that your environment is set up correctly and start up the test server, run:

  npm run check

This will print out an error message if there's a problem. If it doesn't exit
with an error, open index.html (from the root of the test-script folder)
in Google Chrome to finish the check.
