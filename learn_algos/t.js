Automattic (WordPress.com, Gravatar, WooCommerce, etc.) | Backend developer | Remote | https://automattic.com/work-with-us/code-wrangler/
I never thought I would work for 10 years with the same company, but here I am :-) Automattic is the nicest group of people (brings 10x personal happiness), almost no bureaucracy (given it’s 600+ people), just common sense on every level.
On to technical things. We’re looking for more backend developers to work both on APIs, but also on user-facing features. Teams are small, a lot of the code is open-source, backend deploys take few seconds and we do 100+ a day, the CI says tests are passing, scaling and performance are daily concerns.
And some not-so-technical. Users are millions and kinda like us, 100% distributed – we meet in person few times per year anywhere in the world, growing stable business, all internal communication is open to anybody, people rarely leave the company.
Stack:
- PHP REST API
- modern JavaScript single-page app frontend, 100% open-source: http://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso
- various other systems in Python, Go, Erlang, Java…

Etleap | Senior Backend Engineer | San Francisco | Full Time | Onsite
Etleap came to be out of the frustration with how much time data wrangling takes away from the actual analysis. We were just tired of spending time building and maintaining data pipelines. Then we noticed, so is everyone else! That is why we've created an intuitive ETL tool that easily enables the data analysts themselves to integrate data from any source. This way data analysts can do their most significant work faster than ever before.
Now we are looking to add engineers to our core engineering team to help build the infrastructure that modern data teams depend on to create and operate their data warehouse! It shouldn't take a CS degree to use big data effectively, and abstracting away the difficult parts is our mission.
What we want to see in you: - You love data engineering - You build robust and scalable data systems three times as fast as other developers - Coding in Java is second nature to you - You have a passion for improving data analytics - You’re excited to work in a scrappy environment - You’re down to earth and fun to be around. This is an absolute must!
Big plus if you have the following:
- Have experience with Cascading, Docker, and AWS - Know the ins and outs of current big data frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or Flink, but this is not an absolute requirement, as you're a quick learner! - Have startup experience

We're building a note taking app for sales folks. Take notes in Dooly, we update Salesforce for you, and we surface information in the moment to close deals.
Check out our website: https://www.dooly.ai
CRM is broken. You pay a lot of money for the software, then you hire an administrator, and then no one puts the data in because it's not helping them do what they were hired for: to sell. We're on a mission to fix that.
We've spent the last year building a foundation and obsessing on early customers.. we're now seeing the fruits of that. Our customers tell us that they love and couldn't live without Dooly, including some well-known valley brands that we're excited to have using. New deals are coming in on an almost weekly basis. Now we're ramping up to deliver knowledge in the moment and help our customers be the smartest people in their meetings.
We're a small, super-passionate team and we're looking to bring onboard a third well-rounded engineer. Our stack is es6/react/redux on the frontend and rails on the backend.
Everyone here is passionate about design and bringing consumer-grade product to the enterprise.

A lot of our recent projects have been in React, but there still are a number of Angular and Node projects as well.
The staff here seem to actually care about work-life balance here (unlike many of the companies I previously worked for). Also, there are some absolutely brilliant engineers, salespeople, designers, and more here - everyone is very warm and supportive.
Feel free to reach out if you want to chat, my email is notworkingveryhard@gmail.com

Nylas | San Francisco, NYC | Full-time | ONSITE | https://www.nylas.com/jobs/
The Nylas Cloud API makes it an order of magnitude easier for companies to add email, calendar, and contacts integrations to their applications. By being at the core of business to business communication, scheduling, and contacts, we believe we can shape the future of how people work.
We’re hiring senior engineers to help us scale and build new products on top of our APIs. Right now our open-source Python-based sync engine regularly archives terabytes of data across a massive SQL cluster, and our APIs handle tens of millions of requests a day. We aim to scale that several times over in the next year.
Our team (https://www.nylas.com/team/) is roughly equal by identified gender (including engineering) and is comprised of startup founders; Debian contributors; {{Large Tech Corp®}} alums; MIT, Columbia, Yale, CMU, Olin, alums; and a professional dancer from the San Francisco Ballet. We actively and regularly work with the entire team to shape our culture to our ideal of honesty, transparency, individual empowerment, and kindness.
You must have a growth mindset, have enough engineering experience to architect complex systems, have a track record of managing your own projects, have a strong sense of practical shippability over engineering purity, have a natural tendency towards humbleness in your own abilities, and have an innate desire to pass that knowledge onwards.

Foodchain is on a mission to build the most efficient food supply chain, ensuring high quality, fresh, affordable food for everyone. Our aim isn’t to reinvent the supply chain, but instead to make it as efficient and sustainable as possible.
We’re using a technology driven approach to accomplish this mission.
Our platform connects chefs and restaurants to a wide variety of producers in meat, fish, dairy, produce and dry goods. We’ve cut out the middleman and eradicated the warehouse, to guarantee delivery of the freshest, high quality food at the best prices.
We’re looking for a backend engineer to join us in furthering our mission and help build out the technology platform which will be integral to the long term success of Foodchain.
Foodchain is an early stage startup with a small engineering team. This is an opportunity to play a key role in shaping the vision for the platform and share significant responsibility in the team.
We need someone with hands on experience building backend systems and APIs, preferably in SOA or microservice architectures. Hopefully you’ll have experience in dynamic languages like Python or Javascript but also some strongly typed experience with Go, Java or Scala.
Here’s some of the things we’d like you to work on:
- Own the overall architecture of the event based microservices platform
- Develop the API endpoints for the mobile and frontend apps
- Develop integrations with third party providers e.g logistics and accounting
- Work with the rest of the product team to estimate and plan future features
We're based in London but open to remote work.

At ProsperWorks, we've built the CRM that sales teams love to use. We integrate tightly with Gmail, G Suite and RingCentral to give our users up-to-the-minute data without a lot of manual data entry. We have thousands of paying customers, top-tier investors, real revenue and we're growing fast.
We're looking for experienced software engineers to join us. You will work closely with our small cross-functional teams of developers, QA analysts, product managers and designers. We work steadily, collaboratively and iteratively to ship software to customers every two weeks.
Our server is Ruby on Rails, our web client is Ember and we have native Android and iOS apps. Like most mid-stage startups, we're in the process of paying down technical debt as we build a solid foundation to serve us through our "hockey stick" growth. We're committed to automated testing, refactoring and improving code quality; we want every commit to leave the code a little better than we found it while shipping compelling new features to our users every sprint.
Our interview process consists of a phone screen followed by a half day on-site interview of three 45 minute sessions covering algorithmic thinking, system design/architecture and hands-on coding, then a talk with an engineering manager about culture, fit and career goals.

Netflix | Software Engineer | Ruby, Java, Javascript (Ember & React) | Los Gatos, CA | ONSITE (No remote)
Join the Studio team at Netflix. We are a relatively new team within Netflix, working on tools that help us create new Netflix Originals.
The Studio Production Engineering team believes content creators should be focused on creating content, not on the bureaucracy of managing a studio. We believe if we succeed, better content will be created, we will produce more Stranger Things & Master of Nones, and we will bring more joy and awareness to the world through creators.
We build tools for the Studio teams in LA, as well as for non-Netflix employees that are on-set creating our content. (We're currently piloting a new tool on the set of Glow for example).
We're looking for full-stack (Ruby on Rails and EmberJS), completely back-end (Ruby on Rails or Java), and completely front-end (Ember JS or React).
Apply here: https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/864893 or reach out to me (#{my_hn_username}@netflix.com) about the Java and React opportunities, and I'll put you in touch with the right people.
* Note: all of the "ors" in the frameworks that we use relate to specific teams within Studio Engineering.

StackShare | Full-time | San Francisco
https://stackshare.io/stackshare/stackshare
We’re on a mission to create the best place for engineers to figure out how to piece together their tech stack. Our vision is to transform the way that all SaaS tools and infrastructure are bought and sold.
Open roles:
- Front-End Engineer (React + Rails) - https://angel.co/stackshare/jobs/186787-front-end-react-soft...
- Developer Evangelist - https://angel.co/stackshare/jobs/86973-developer-evangelist
- Technical Content Manager - https://angel.co/stackshare/jobs/145270-content-manager
We're a small distributed team of 5 on a fresh growth spurt and building out a core local presence here in SF. Our Stack: Ruby/Rails/React/PostgreSQL https://stackshare.io/stackshare.
How we work:
Every engineer owns and is responsible for the products they build (e.g. Stack News). Before writing any code, the engineer tagged to the product writes a blog post announcing it to the StackShare community. From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we're building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.
Interview process:
Phone Screen -> Technical Homework -> Technical Interviews -> Product Interviews -> Offer!

Enigma | New York, NY | https://www.enigma.com/
We're a Series B company based in New York City and backed by NEA Ventures, Two Sigma Investments, Comcast and American Express. Enigma was founded in 2012 in order to centralize and normalize public data globally (think Google for public data).
Our view is that public data reflects more of our everyday lives than most of us realize. It’s everywhere, from a plane taking off from an airport to a barrel of crude oil flowing through a pipeline to a new drug being approved. These things exist in specific and separate public datasets, but together, they can provide a vast and powerful view of what’s happening in the world.
https://www.enigma.com/
https://www.enigma.com/labs
Today, we’ve grown into an operational data management and intelligence company that uses public data to inform and train each of our products. Our mission is to empower people to interpret and improve, the world around them. We believe in curiosity and the power of discovery.
We’re actively hiring and would love to hear from you. Below are links to a few of key open engineering roles, but for the full list of openings, see here: https://www.enigma.com/careers/openings

Qtum (https://qtum.org) | Global | Remote | Full-time | Software Engineer
Qtum is a smart contract platform built on a blockchain model similar to Bitcoin. We aim to drive the entire smart contract space forward with this project. Qtum is still young, and has been around for around 1.5 years. We use a fully remote workflow but typically try to all meetup in Shanghai once a year or so. We have team members based around the world, including China, USA, Canada, Sweden, Morocco, Colombia, and many others.
We are currently looking to expand our engineering team by 1 or 2 well experienced people. First of all, no blockchain experience is necessary (though it is always helpful). Qtum is aiming to implement an x86 virtual machine on which smart contracts can be executed. So, we need people to help us build the virtual machine, and test it to make sure it is correct (since fixing mistakes is very hard). We are also looking not just for engineers to build the virtual machine, but also to craft an operating system-like environment in which smart contracts can run. So, this may provide common necessities like memory allocation, string manipulation, etc... along with porting languages like C++, Rust, and Go to be easily used within the smart contract environment.
So, in summary we are looking for someone that loves working at the low level, bare metal level. If you have operating system development experience, that's a plus. If you live and breathe assembler, we'd like to speak with you. No matter if your preferred architecture is x86, ARM, or whatever. Even if you made a cool Z80 assembly program for your TI-84. It's all good stuff. We will be implementing most of the core logic in C++, but Rust and Go experience is a plus, especially with low level experience porting or dealing with the low-level details of the compilers and operating environment.
We take testing and code reviews seriously, being a blockchain project where mistakes can cost millions or more. We use a pull-request model, where each PR must be approved, and we have an always growing set of automated tests. Attention to detail and experience with working on security critical software is a plus. We'd prefer highly experienced senior people at this point, but we are accepting of anyone with experience in bare metal or assembly development. (Yes, we include open source hobby projects as experience)
I'm the Lead Developer and one of three Co-founders of Qtum, Jordan Earls. Email me with your resume or CV at earlz@qtum.org, and make sure to include a brief description of why this sounds interesting to you, and what makes you qualified for it.
PS: Unlike the common misconception, we do not require that you accept Bitcoin for your salary despite being a blockchain project.

DrivenData Labs | Software engineer (Python) w/ focus on data applications | Berkeley, CA | ONSITE | FULLTIME
DrivenData brings the transformative power of data science to organizations tackling the world’s biggest challenges. We run online machine learning challenges with social impact (drivendata.org), and we work directly with mission-driven organizations to drive change with statistical modeling, data engineering, and tool building (drivendata.co).
We are looking for a talented software engineer who is interested in data — possibly looking to transition into data engineering or data science — and in using their job to take on tough social challenges. As a core member of a small team your role will include managing code development, brainstorming approaches to engineering problems, working closely with data science and machine learning developers, and taking an open and constructive mindset to getting things done across multiple projects. You’ll work directly with data scientists that started their careers as software engineers, bringing an experienced understanding of software processes alongside opportunities to learn new quant skills, tools, and ways of approaching data applications. This is a full time position in Berkeley, CA (SF/Bay Area).
Doing client-facing work involves turning uncertainty into a reasonable path forward. As a team, we value unemotional arguments for how to proceed based on evidence, and we want somebody who can be assertive enough to get the point across but dispassionate enough to plow through even if their favored course of action doesn't happen this time. We're looking for somebody who can ask the right questions to figure out what is important, iterate between brainstorming together and working independently, and exercise sound engineering judgment to make reasonable decisions under conditions of ambiguity.
Duties and responsibilities: internal software development, maintain our Python codebase for drivendata.org, fix bugs, add features, safely refactor and maintain test coverage. Develop new internal tooling and improve on existing apps. Client-facing software development; build a variety of applications, generally small green-field apps. Light DevOps Tasks (spinning up EC2 instances, logging into a servers for diagnosing issues, setting up databases both locally and in the cloud).
Requirements: Advanced proficiency in Python, practical experience with writing solid and well-tested code, working knowledge of SQL, and comfort with Linux a necessity. No need to have a background in math or a CS degree, but the job will involve a lot of quantitative thinking so the applicant should not be afraid of math Working on a small team means doing a little bit of a lot of things. Able to quickly learn and adopt new technologies based on client needs; a typical engagement may include at least one data technology we haven't all worked with before. Must be able to read appropriate documentation in order to write clean, idiomatic code.
Nice-to-have experience: IaaS like Amazon AWS or PaaS like Heroku, Docker, big data tools like Spark and Hadoop, tools design for data-intensive applications e.g. Cassandra, Storm, Elasticsearch, etc.
If interested, send a resume and links to things you'd like us to see (e.g. Github, personal site, blog or projects) to isaac [at] drivendata.org with "HN" in the subject line.

CLOUDERA| US & Global | Engineering, G&A, Sales & More| Onsite | Full-time | https://goo.gl/5zCuS2
CLOUDERA BACKGROUND: We generate vastly more data today than ever before. There are, by IDC estimates, 4.4 zettabytes, or 4,400,000,000 terabytes, of data in the world today. That number is so big, it’s hard to comprehend. It’s the equivalent of 600 million years of high-definition video, for example. And 90% of that data has been created in just the past two years. Four years from now, experts predict there will be ten times as much -- 44 zettabytes.
This explosion of data comes from the 6.4 billion devices connected to the internet, and that number will grow nearly five-fold in the next four years. Some of those devices are computers, of course, handling sales at supermarkets, trading stocks on Wall Street, or reading DNA sequences for researchers at pharmaceutical companies. Some, though, are sensors in elevators, cars, on factory lines and in oil wells. Some are connected to people, tracking temperature and heart rate and more.
Computing is so cheap, and networks are so ubiquitous, that it’s possible now to instrument and measure almost anything we care about.
Cloudera was founded in 2008 to help businesses capture, store and analyze that data. Half of our original founders are still at the helm. We built a software platform that can handle the huge amounts of data now available. We developed a powerful collection of processing and analytic capabilities. Our customers are able to ask very deep questions of their data, and get their answers quickly.
WHY CLOUDERA? Cloudera is the largest single contributor to the Apache Hadoop project and we have trained more Hadoop engineers than any other organization on Earth.
Amazing people - We are a fun & smart team,including many of the top luminaries in Hadoop and related open source communities. We frequently interact with the research community, collaborate with engineers at other top companies & host cutting edge researchers for tech talks.
Innovative work - Cloudera pushes the frontier of big data & distributed computing, as our track record shows. We work on high-profile open source projects, interacting daily with engineers at other exciting companies, speaking at meet-ups, etc.
Great culture - Transparent and open meritocracy. Everybody is always thinking of better ways to do things, and coming up with ideas that make a difference. We build our culture to be the best workplace in our careers.
*Experience - be part of the exhilarating ride at a fast-growing post-IPO startup
