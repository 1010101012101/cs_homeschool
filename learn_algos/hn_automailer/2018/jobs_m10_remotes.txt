      Microsoft | Consultants, Architects, Software Engineers, and everything else| REMOTE, INTERNS, WORLDWIDE
Microsoft is recruiting across all technical roles. Our engineering roles are primarily located in the major tech hubs (Seattle/Redmond, Bay Area, Boston, London, etc...), but we also have a large remote "field" doing application development work in consulting, highly advanced technical support, and technical sales support.

We write code and provide advice that delivers the largest, most complex and strategic implementations of Microsoft technologies for external customers. As we are a distributed organization, at least 50% travel is expected. Recruiting is being conducted broadly across all technical stacks. If you are a great developer and eager to learn new technologies or platforms, we want to talk to you.

Example projects include: developing blockchain based inventory control systems, tracking biological pathogens, reinventing an organization's recruiting platform and process, developing massive IoT telemetry ingestion platforms, and building media delivery platforms for some of the biggest sporting events in the world.
You can reach out to me directly by going to https://aka.ms/AppsHnRecruit or you can apply to Microsoft at https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en
                      
                  

      Of all companies, I never expected Microsoft to be remote friendly. Nice.I worked there for a long time as a Senior Developer. I certainly wouldn't call it remote friendly unless you have a manager willing to fight for your ability to work remote.We are hiring for field (consulting, support, tech sales/architecture and some customer facing engineering) positions remotely, with varying degrees of travel. Core engineering teams are still largely on Prem, although I’ve been delivering software on the consulting side so long I’m a bit out of touch there.If this is the division I am part of, there are definitely remote friendly roles available.  The nature of the role will impact travel.  My current role balance is about 25% travel, 30-50% coding, the remainder mentoring, design, etc.Any Engineering positions REMOTE?Core engineering, not really, although Xamarin might be an exception. Customer facing engineering, consulting, support engineering, and other field based software dev roles are primarily distributed, with varying degrees of travel. Ive been doing application development in the consulting services wing for quite a while now, so I’m a bit out of touch with the product engineering groups.Hi Chris, thanks for posting. Just reached out to you via HN form. Cheers!United States Digital Service | Senior Software Engineers, Senior Site Reliability Engineers, Senior Designers, and more! | Washington, DC | ONSITE https://www.usds.gov/

You'll join a team of the most talented technologists from across the private sector and government. No government resume required! We work on some of the biggest issues affecting the American people there are, immigration, veterans service, students, health care, and more. We're especially looking for talented senior engineers to join us to help shift move government tech in the right direction.

      We've got a lot of impactful projects to work on. It turns out that government systems/technology need a lot of help, and USDS is well-positioned to assist.I applaud you for what you're doing. I also know you've heard this 100 times Matt, but maybe it'll be the 101st time that makes the decisions makers allow this. Allow remote.This country spans a large area & a lot of it is full of people who would love to help their country do better, but few want to move to DC. The US "Digital" Service should be a shining example to others of how to work remotely.
                      
                  
      I hear you. Right now a lot of our meetings involve sitting with or across from decision makers, and being in DC is really critical for that.For what it's worth, some of our individual agency engagements (e.g. VA or DoD) might allow you to come to DC for a short while like three months and then work remotely after that. But most of our work is in DC, at least for now.
                      
                  
      If that was something you promoted for the summer months when school is out & one could bring their family with, I think you would have a lot of takers.Best wishes!
                      
                  
      Just keep senior people there as code reviewers and 'account managers' who would sit down with stakeholders from DC. Then open source some of the other projects or at least add approved citizens that could work remotely on low-security projects. (Like some of the commenters above).I’ve said it to you before, and I’ll say it again, thank you for your service Matt. Listened to you on the TWiT network and have followed your career ever since.
I’m on vacation this week, and while my wife reads, I spelunk data in the US Census and American Community Survey. I’ve been looking this week at polling proximity for voters based on demographics and RUCA coding, to see how fair access is to voting throughout the country. I’ve had to primarily use third party data sources because the government datasets are poor or non existent (thanks to Census Reporter, Google Civic API, and Google Distance Matrix API).

I hope other engineers like yourself take the challenge and seek to improve our technology. We need it, and it’s important!
Thanks again Matt.
                      
                  
      It sounds like your current gig would keep you 100% busy, but if timing or life changes might allow for you to come do a tour, it sounds you've been bit by the same civic bug as us!Definitely. Maybe need to get Google to buy my startup and I’ll go spend a couple years in service :)
If I’m ever in DC I’ll reach out. Would love to take a tour and learn more.
Best of luck to you and the team, Matt. Email is in my profile if I can ever be of assistance.
                      
                  
      Is USDS doing any work with the IRS? I'm currently working at a tax policy think tank, and from what I can see I think the IRS could definitely use help on a number of fronts. Probably the biggest thing: they've got to finish rewriting their tax filing system to not be in assembly--don't know if they've made good progress on getting it into Java. Their SOI data could also use a better system for hosting/distribution along the lines of data.gov.We have done some work with the IRS in the past, such as https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/irs-secure-acce...We don't currently have an engagement at the IRS/Treasury, but if we get more people to sign up, that would increase the odds. :)
                      
                  
      Just FYI the IRS is hiring directly. I keep seeing them advertising open software engineering positions in Austin, TX, though I'm uncertain about other locations.Please don’t help the irs.Are you Libertarian or do you have a non-partisan objection to the IRS specifically?In my experience, "starving the beast" just means you're locked in a room with a starving beast. Bureaucracies can be awful to deal with. But if you strip them of resources, the laws that dictate their mission are unchanged. Any hope of expedient resolution of issues is gone. People who, often through no choice of their own, must deal with these bureaucracies will receive worst treatment and outcomes. Unpopular though the IRS may be, an IRS that can't function correctly is more dangerous to individuals and society than one that can.I'm struggling to think of any legitimate objection to the IRS that could be non-partisan.It's always been my daydream to work with a company like this and serve my country.At my current job I joined because it directly helps people as well by helping them shed off debt they cannot handle. We all do what we can to help others. Kudos to you!
                      
                  
      That's important! We have done some work on that around student loans: https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/what-if-you-could...If you're interested, consider applying!
                      
                  
      It's too bad that there aren't intern positions. Lots of DC students would be interested I'm sure.You might want to check out https://www.fedscoop.com/civic-digital-fellows-demo-day-2018... if you're looking for that!Any nontechnical roles ever come up? I'm at the e-Residency program in Estonia leading a team but definitely want to come back to the States and serve at some pointMost of our work involves engineers, designers, and product managers. Under the product category, there's also the notion of a "bureaucracy hacker" who helps get things done and launched. Those folks might not always be super technical, but are good at pushing to make forward progress.I am impressed with the work your team is doing!Has the current administration changed the work/mission/culture at all?We work on non-partisan projects, and the way we prioritize projects hasn't changed. So we're still able to get important things done for Veterans, small businesses, doctors/patients, students, immigrants, soldiers, etc.This is a recent overview of the sort of projects that we're working on: https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2017/fall/ It's all great stuff that you'd feel proud to tell your family and friends about.
                      
                  
      > We work on non-partisan projects
As the existence and prioritization of executive branch projects is an outcome of partisan politics, that's only even possibly true in the sense that some government projects, even in this administration, aren't particularly subject to partisan controversy.
But while it would be possibly true in that sense, it doesn't seem to be actually true in that sense, as a review of the highlight projects at https://www.usds.gov/work shows that many serve goals that have been the subject of intense partisan controversy over the last couple years.
                      
                  
      This is interesting. I’m a veteran and know first hand how terrible the system can be.
I’ve taight myself JavaScript and have recently learned Django with my current position. I don’t have any plans to leave the company now, but working on systems that can help out fellow veterans more easily is tempting.
Maybe in a year or two I’ll revisit this :)
                      
                  
      You might consider applying. We're well-positioned to improve things at Veterans Affairs. I've had a Veteran say "I had trouble deciding about my GI Bill benefits. I'd like to build a tool to make it easier for other Veterans." And then they did!Check out this GI Bill comparison tool that Marc (the Veteran I mentioned) built: https://www.vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/ . Seeing vets help out brothers and sisters who have served is really inspiring.

      Command E | Lead Engineer (#1) | San Francisco, CA | Onsite/Remote | Full Time
We're building a next-generation search tool, and we're hiring employee #1—a lead engineer who wants to get in at the ground floor (pre-seed/seed stage). Both co-founders are engineers who worked at First Round Capital, Eventbrite, and Digg. We worked together at a top VC firm for 3 years and have a healthy mix of engineering skills + business sense. We’re looking for a unique engineer who is persistent, exploratory, multi-disciplinary, and demonstrates leadership.

Command E helps provides effortless, lightning-fast navigation of your chaotic workspace. Command E lets you instantly search your cloud data (i.e. Google Drive, Salesforce, Trello/Asana, Dropbox/Box, wikis, and more). We’re bringing the “fuzzy finder” file-switching experience of vi/Emacs/IDEs to business people. Our unique technology searches across many cloud providers and displays results as you type, in less than 10ms.

Our stack is Electron/React/Redux/SQLite. We’re using ES6, async/await, Promises, and all the cool new JavaScript stuff, but the search index is backed by rock-solid native SQLite/C++. From a technical perspective there's tons of fun space to explore—high-performance full-text search indexing, fast async UIs, modern dev frameworks, encryption, or deploying cross-platform desktop apps.

We're at 3rd & Market in San Francisco and have legendary VC/angel investors. We met each other 4 years ago through a "Who's Hiring?” thread, so we're excited to see who responds to this one!
There isn't much publicly available about us yet, but email benstandefer at gmail dot com and I'll share all the details.

      Nava | Infrastructure Engineers, Fullstack Software Engineers, Designers | Washington DC, San Francisco SF, New York NYC, REMOTE | On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k+ + equity + benefits | We're a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.
It turns out there’s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why we’re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteran’s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.
It’s surprising how much can be done by a small group of diverse, empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. We’ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable. If you feel the same way, we'd love to hear from you.

      Zen Educate | Full stack engineer (React and Ruby) | London | Ideally onsite, but will consider remote | Full-time
UK schools spend over £2bn per year covering short-term absences with supply teachers. The current model is exclusively reliant on agencies that charge a massive commission and are terribly inefficient — everything is paper and phone-call based. We’re using technology to change this by building a marketplace to connect schools directly with teachers, pulling hundreds of millions of waste out of the education system.

We are well-funded by high-profile investors, have had significant early traction, and are led by start-up veterans behind two of London’s most prominent tech companies. As an early employee, you’ll play a significant role in the development of the company and have the opportunity for rapid career progression and learning.

We’re looking for a full stack engineer happy to work with React, Ruby and React native and who likes coming in each day working with a small, committed team on a mission for good.

We can sponsor visas if you’re interested in taking a move to London.

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in alot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”

Learnetto is an online education site (https://learnetto.com). It's a solo bootstrapped business, steadily growing with a few thousand developers learning programming skills through tutorials and courses.

I'm working on a new service to offer 1-on-1 coaching and mentoring to junior and mid level developers.

So I'm looking for multiple senior developers who have expertise and confidence in teaching Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Node, Express, Python, Django, React, Vue, Angular, SQL, Devops, AWS and other technologies.

If you have any experience teaching online through blog posts, tutorials, courses or books, you might be the right type of person I'm looking for.

If you don't have experience teaching yet, but do have tech expertise and are interested in getting into teaching, then I'm also interested in hearing from you.

I'm looking to pay anywhere between $100-$200 per hour based on your skills.

This will be highly rewarding work because you will help developers who are starting out in their careers to learn faster and progress quickly.

If you're interested, please fill in this form with your details - https://goo.gl/forms/fFYHV9bzVHyxE5DR2

If you have any questions, email me at hrishi@learnetto.com

      Blue Canvas | Sr. Engineer | San Francisco, Berlin or Remote | ~$100-120k + generous equity
Blue Canvas (https://bluecanvas.io/) is a source control product for the Salesforce developer ecosystem.

We've built a hosted service with automatic source control that "just works", and modern tools to review and deploy updates. We are in a growing, opportunity-rich enterprise market: For every $1 paid to Salesforce, $3 more are spent on customizing it.

Looking for a Python, Go or Node developer to join our 2 person team. An interest in source control systems and theory is a major plus.

So far we have hired slowly because we believe in maintaining high-revenue per employee. We admire companies like Basecamp, Mailchimp and Atlassian. We are funded by customer revenue and Indie.vc (http://www.indie.vc/).

Our stack is primarily Python and Go (Node.js developers interested in learning Go should also apply). You’ll get to work directly with the CTO on important technology decisions.
Email team@bluecanvas.io if you're interested. No recruiters please.
                      
                  

      Upflow | Paris or Remote (CET -2 / +2) | Full-time | https://upflow.io
We're building the reference payment platform for B2B businesses in Europe.

Getting paid on time remains a significant problem for B2B businesses. We're on a mission to revolutionise how companies manage their outstanding payments. To do this, we're building a fully fledged payment platform from scratch - think Stripe but for traditional (non-tech) businesses. It's an extremely complex and multi-faceted problem which affects almost 500,000 businesses across Europe.

We run on React / GraphQL / Node / Express / Postgres

We're still really small (3 developers) and are looking for great hackers to work across the stack on problems ranging from payments, security, product and data.

      OpenMessage | Senior Software Engineers | https://openmessage.io | NYC | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE if willing to relocate to NYC | $90-$130k + 0.1-2.5%
Hello fellow engineers and future teammates,

We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services. Being able to fuse realistic human-like conversation design ("character") and NLP/ML with the ubiquity of SMS/MMS (and RCS/Business Chat soon) is why I personally get out of bed in the morning as an engineer at OM.

It's also nice that goal-oriented conversations are like little conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our prioritization and decision making so there is a lot of interesting and impactful stuff to do there.

If you're into massive scaling and operations, we are currently humming along at hundreds of messages per second and have a roadmap to get to millions in the next few months. We need your help to get there.

For the design-inclined, one of our major features is the conversational composer frontend with previews/canvas drawing etc. that will evolve according to what the messaging channels can support in terms of content types and interaction. Messages are personalized in different ways.

We are hooking commerce functionality into the conversations as well. Buying products this way is a lot of fun as a user. Thanks to our design, we can kick off any kind of API calls as a natural part of the conversation without adding complexity to the codebase.

Our current tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker. We are exploring Go for some things and prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles. Creativity is best applied to data structures and decoupling.

We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy as well. No jerks or brogrammers, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!

There is a small code challenge that checks for data manipulation techniques. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding. Existing open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.
Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!

      Podaris | Javascript developer | London, UK, | Remote | https://www.podaris.com/
Podaris is re-inventing how the world plans cities. We're developing a platform for urban infrastructure planning that combines elements of BIM and GIS, with a focus on agile, real-time collaboration.

We’re looking for a full-stack software engineer to join our growing team. You'll be able to make a big impact, joining a small but very enthusiastic team. For this role, you'll primarily focus on mathematical problems: computational geometry, parametric constraint solvers, network routing optimisation, etc -- problems that come up in the course of modeling both physical transport infrastructure and transport network simulation and analysis. However you should be enough of a generalist to be unafraid to dive into other areas of the application where needed.

Technology-wise, Podaris is built on Javascript/ES6, Meteor.js, OpenStreetMap, and OpenLayers. Your expertise with Javascript is more important to us than your experience with the particular libraries that we use. Experience with building large single-page apps is particularly helpful. Experience with Java-based OSM routers (and other associated or similar tooling) is also a strong plus.

We're based in London, UK, but are open to remote workers from anywhere in the world, provided we can establish a collaborative rapport. Currently we can only offer a six-month contract, but will aim to convert that into a salaried role pending additional funding. Equity is also available for extraordinarily talented individuals.

Namebase is a top-level domain registrar and exchange for the Handshake blockchain. Namebase makes it easy for anyone to buy/sell Handshake coins (HNS) and use their HNS to register TLDs.-- Why should you care?
The internet wasn't built to handle the scale it supports today. The DNS we rely on is supported by ducktape solutions that fail to serve the security and reliability needs of today's internet. For instance, compromised Certificate Authorities threaten SSL (https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/certificate-authority-vulner...), and domains get seized for arbitrary reasons, even for good actors (https://twitter.com/zoho/status/1044249648993525760?s=20).
Handshake fixes these issues by letting anyone register secure, censorship-resistant TLDs on the blockchain. More details can be found in the whitepaper https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt.

Namebase is driving adoption of Handshake's DNS by making it easier to use and more powerful.

We are looking for an experienced frontend engineer to join our team of 4 including 2 engineers.

We don't require experience with our tech stack, just the motivation and ability to learn. For more details on the role, email me and I'd love to tell you more - Tieshun, tieshun at namebase.io, Namebase CEO

Havenly provides interior design services, all online, at an extremely accessible price point. For a flat fee starting from $79, we set you up with your own personal interior designer, matched exclusively to your style, who works with you virtually to decorate your room.

This is an exciting time at Havenly, our tech team is growing rapidly and I'm looking to augment the team with senior technologists who have been successful in scaling consumer products! I'm looking for full-stack engineers, engineers passionate about managing reasonably large amounts of heterogeneous ecomm data (10M+ SKUs from 400+ retailers) and systems engineers who like their infrastructure as code.

I'm looking for people who want to make a big impact in an environment free of BS and focused on outcomes. Good fits in the product development team tend to crave ownership over their area of the product and prefer not to just be told what code to write. Productive cross function collaboration with product, design, marketing, and business operations should be something that excites you.

      SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 6 months ago I moved to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We’ve hired 3 remote developers so far and it’s been a great experience!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours.
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

About us:

Drops’ goal is to turn language learning into a delightful game while ensuring effective learning. Our app is in the Appstore for 3 years, teaches 31 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - Editors' Choice on the Play Store - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe. We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Git and Trello and have a release twice a week. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 7 million, a monthly active of >800,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.

You can find us here: http://drops.app.link/

About you:

You’ll be responsible for improving the quantity, quality and reliability of the multivariant tests we run.

You’re a no-nonsense person, who is comfortable taking ownership of all aspects of our analytics & growth funnel, who has experience in working at a product company, and who can bring us insights, initiatives and execution that will help us grow.

We want everyone to see the big picture: this means you already pushed your boundaries outside of the strict data realm, and are knowledgeable about mobile and web growth frameworks, ASO, SEO, best practices regarding retention and monetization.

We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product & driven to grow professionally, than in managing people.

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.

Storj develops an open-source, decentralized cloud storage platform called Storj (pronounced storage) that is disrupting the cloud storage market. Rather than storing files in a data center, Storj works by encrypting and partitioning files, then sending the shards to a network of devices contributed by our global community—with active storage nodes on every continent except Antarctica. We rent unused hard drive space from users all over the globe, operating active storage nodes on every continent (except Antarctica). Our core target is selling to software developers and channel partners who get higher quality, privacy, and security at 1/6th the price. We are laying the groundwork for the future of decentralization and web 3.0.

Headquartered in Atlanta, Storj is a global company with North American employees in California, Washington, Utah, Michigan, and Georgia, and European employees in Germany and Bulgaria.

Most of our engineering team sits in Atlanta, where the company was founded. We're in the Atlanta Tech Village, Buckhead. The bulk of our marketing team is in our downtown Salt Lake City office at the Impact Hub co-office building located at 150 S. State Street.

Many of them have managed or co-managed: design, assembly supervision, post-assembly tests, start-up of devices and electrical power engineering systems, practically in all newly erected or modernized power plants, combined heat and power plants, substations and industrial plants in Poland and abroad.

The Energotest R&D department team is looking for a senior developer who would be willing to take part in setting new directions in the development of systems for the broader "Industry 4.0". The person will help us change the world of automation systems, face the task of creating tools for engineers and firmware for devices manufactured by Energotest. Working together in the R&D department, we are happy to share our knowledge, but the ability to independently solve problems and look for information will be a desirable skill. If you have skills that do not meet all of the following requirements, but enter other areas of programming and feel that they will help develop our project or make it a unique product, we will gladly talk to you. Currently we are building a device (based on embedded Linux) and some tools to configure it (with C++/Qt).

Essential skills: GNU/Linux, Git, Bash, C++, Boost, Qt

Nice to have (in random order):

* Python (and Boost.Python)

* Experience with embedded Linux (yocto)

* Modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17)

* Functional programming (Haskell, Erlang)

* Web technologies (Elm, PureScript)

Extra notes:

* It doesn't harm if you also know MFC, C#, Delphi and Windows in general

* Official language in Energotest is Polish

* Remote work is partly possible (1 day/week)

      Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers...). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Square Cash, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of remote, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but work from anywhere they want.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:
- You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.
- You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.
- You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.
- You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.
- You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
- You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

      Facet Development | Remote | Ex-FAANG engineers (Full Stack, Front End, and everything else)
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post here or not - we aren't a recruiting firm or job board. We are a home for freelancers/contractors and we have several openings.

Facet Development is a freelancer network made up exclusively of ex-FAANG engineers. Facet does the work of finding freelancing jobs/projects and then we send them out to the devs in the network. We also provide project management and billing/collections, help with taxes, etc, so freelancers get to spend a lot more of their time doing the enjoyable parts of freelancing and not trying to run a small business.

We target FAANG companies and companies that wish they could hire FAANG devs when finding work for our freelancer network. When I was a dev lead at Microsoft, bringing on vendors or outsourcing was a terrible experience, because they always seemed to be below our hiring bar. So I started Facet to solve the problem I had when I was an engineering manager at a FAANG company.

If you are a FAANG or ex-FAANG dev that wants to switch to freelancing or already is, you should join: https://www.facetdev.com/developer-network

However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

      Dataquest Labs | Senior Infrastructure Engineer | Remote | www.dataquest.io
At Dataquest Labs, we teach data science interactively online to hundreds of thousands of students worldwide. We're focused on teaching skills and building intuition from the ground up with our project based curriculum. Unlike most educational options, we focus on motivating students to learn, not just content delivery. We have students go from little programming or data science knowledge to jobs at companies like SpaceX, Amazon, and Microsoft. You can read about some of the success stories here -- https://www.dataquest.io/stories -- and reviews rom our students here -- https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/dataquest

A key part of our vertically integrated approach to teaching data science is providing a rich environment for learning. Students are always writing code on our platform as they learn new concepts in programming, databases, statistics, data visualization, and machine learning. We're one of a few online learning companies where maintaining and improving our own code running infrastructure is a core competency.

We're looking to hire a Senior Infrastructure Engineer to help us take our infrastructure to the next level. This person will work to empower other backend engineers, help us build a better devops culture, and will have the opportunity to work on deep technical problems at the intersection of backend, devops, and tooling.

On the company side, we're a fully distributed team with people in 5 time zones (4 in the US and 1 in Europe). We're also a profitable, mostly bootstrapped company that prides itself on growing deliberately and empowering students. We hold company offsites 2 to 3 times a year and even enjoy meeting with our students in person at these events.

Here's a preview of the requirements for this position:

* 5+ years of backend infrastructure experience

* 3+ years of Python experience

* Experience with Docker & Kubernetes

* Experience creating on-call rotations

* Experience working on a team with strong devops culture

* A generalist with experience contributing to both backend and infrastructure systems

If you have any questions, you can reach out to me (srini at dataquest.io), the Director of Engineering at Dataquest.

      Parse.ly | Growth & Data Lead | Remote | Fully Distributed Team | https://parse.ly
Parse.ly is the web's attention engine. As a measurement layer running across the web, Parse.ly quantifies how visitors respond to online content. Our products are then used by the web's biggest brands and publishers to understand audience attention across the internet in real-time. Our flagship product is Parse.ly Analytics (https://parse.ly/analytics), and is already used by over 400 enterprise customers (https://parse.ly/customers).

But, Parse.ly is just getting started. We just launched Parse.ly Currents (https://parse.ly/currents), a new product that helps people understand internet-wide trends and how content/attention flows online.

As the Growth & Data Lead for Parse.ly, you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, and you want to take a B2B software company out of its successful niche and across the chasm into the broader market. You are comfortable with remote & fully distributed teams. To excel here, you'll work with designers and web developers as collaborators, and be able to leverage data-oriented growth marketing strategies, such as launching search engine optimized public products built atop Parse.ly's data, or important sharing features in our existing sites and products.

You are the kind of person who'd enjoy the books "Hacking Growth", "Traction", "Four Steps to the Epiphany", and "High Growth Handbook". For bonus points, you also care about SaaS enterprise sales. For example, you are the kind of person who enjoyed Dan Pink’s "To Sell is Human".

In this role, you'd run a small team of designers and developers that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s public website, technical documentation, knowledge base, emails/newsletters, data studies, and blog. You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to any of these projects, with a goal of growing sign-ups (and customers) for these products. From a technical standpoint, you'll be data savvy, know some SQL, and be comfortable working with designers/developers, who themselves are comfortable with a modern JavaScript and Python development stack. You'll also use analytics tools like Google Analytics, MixPanel and yes, even, Parse.ly itself, to understand engagement of our visitors, and to position us for more growth in new channels like organic search, social sharing, data-driven press, and free (self-service) data products.

If you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, this job is for you. If you are a former startup founder seeking to relocate to an established startup, but want to continue the path of deploying lean growth techniques, this role may be especially suited for you.

Apply here:

Email work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/projects you think may be relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile. Make sure to mention HN and the "Growth & Data Lead" role. Also, please list your timezone, working hours, and location. Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US/Eastern timezone, due to the timezone makeup of this team.
^ A note on our fully distributed team. The mission of our lean distributed team is described here: https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission. We happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. We expect you to be comfortable with this setup, and collaborating with people primarily over Zoom/GMeet, GitHub, Slack, and email. The cool thing is, this lets you set up your ideal work environment; here's a photograph of mine running two full-screen Parse.ly Analytics dashboards on my monitors: https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73.
