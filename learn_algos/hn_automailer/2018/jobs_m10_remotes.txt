ago [-]Command E | Lead Engineer (#1) | San Francisco, CA | Onsite/Remote | Full Time
We're building a next-generation search tool, and we're hiring employee #1—a lead engineer who wants to get in at the ground floor (pre-seed/seed stage). Both co-founders are engineers who worked at First Round Capital, Eventbrite, and Digg. We worked together at a top VC firm for 3 years and have a healthy mix of engineering skills + business sense. We’re looking for a unique engineer who is persistent, exploratory, multi-disciplinary, and demonstrates leadership.

Command E helps provides effortless, lightning-fast navigation of your chaotic workspace. Command E lets you instantly search your cloud data (i.e. Google Drive, Salesforce, Trello/Asana, Dropbox/Box, wikis, and more). We’re bringing the “fuzzy finder” file-switching experience of vi/Emacs/IDEs to business people. Our unique technology searches across many cloud providers and displays results as you type, in less than 10ms.

Our stack is Electron/React/Redux/SQLite. We’re using ES6, async/await, Promises, and all the cool new JavaScript stuff, but the search index is backed by rock-solid native SQLite/C++. From a technical perspective there's tons of fun space to explore—high-performance full-text search indexing, fast async UIs, modern dev frameworks, encryption, or deploying cross-platform desktop apps.

We're at 3rd & Market in San Francisco and have legendary VC/angel investors. We met each other 4 years ago through a "Who's Hiring?” thread, so we're excited to see who responds to this one!
There isn't much publicly available about us yet, but email benstandefer at gmail dot com and I'll share all the details.

We’re looking for a senior developer with experience in extracting unstructured data out of PDFs, preferably with Perl.

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in alot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”

UK schools spend over £2bn per year covering short-term absences with supply teachers. The current model is exclusively reliant on agencies that charge a massive commission and are terribly inefficient — everything is paper and phone-call based. We’re using technology to change this by building a marketplace to connect schools directly with teachers, pulling hundreds of millions of waste out of the education system.

We are well-funded by high-profile investors, have had significant early traction, and are led by start-up veterans behind two of London’s most prominent tech companies. As an early employee, you’ll play a significant role in the development of the company and have the opportunity for rapid career progression and learning.

We’re looking for a full stack engineer happy to work with React, Ruby and React native and who likes coming in each day working with a small, committed team on a mission for good.

ago [-]OpenMessage | Senior Software Engineers | https://openmessage.io | NYC | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE if willing to relocate to NYC | $90-$130k + 0.1-2.5%
Hello fellow engineers and future teammates,

We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services. Being able to fuse realistic human-like conversation design ("character") and NLP/ML with the ubiquity of SMS/MMS (and RCS/Business Chat soon) is why I personally get out of bed in the morning as an engineer at OM.

It's also nice that goal-oriented conversations are like little conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our prioritization and decision making so there is a lot of interesting and impactful stuff to do there.

If you're into massive scaling and operations, we are currently humming along at hundreds of messages per second and have a roadmap to get to millions in the next few months. We need your help to get there.

For the design-inclined, one of our major features is the conversational composer frontend with previews/canvas drawing etc. that will evolve according to what the messaging channels can support in terms of content types and interaction. Messages are personalized in different ways.

We are hooking commerce functionality into the conversations as well. Buying products this way is a lot of fun as a user. Thanks to our design, we can kick off any kind of API calls as a natural part of the conversation without adding complexity to the codebase.

Our current tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker. We are exploring Go for some things and prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles. Creativity is best applied to data structures and decoupling.

We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy as well. No jerks or brogrammers, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!

There is a small code challenge that checks for data manipulation techniques. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding. Existing open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.
Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!

We make it easy to place group orders and have a coworker deliver your lunch or coffee right to your desk. Our value-add for merchants is to increase their order volume and repeat business. Additionally we provide merchants with valuable insights into their local customer behaviour, allowing for highly targeted local marketing campaigns.

We recently closed a $70M Series C round and are looking to double our engineering team to 60. We are mostly focusing on intermediate and senior talent. Come help us digitize local commerce!

We make TiDB, a scale-out database that is always consistent, always online, and MySQL compatible. The job listing is for the international team based out of SF. Right now there is great adoption in China and we are trying to make this amazing technology available to the rest of the world [1].
Our tech stack is Go, Rust, Kubernetes, and TiDB.
You can work on making an amazing cloud product or do low-level database hacking, depending on your skill set.
I like working on TiDB because I get to be a part of a big change going on in databases and work with a highly-skilled results oriented team that works well together. I am continually learning new things, but I get to both make an impact by applying my existing experience.

  * PYTHON ENGINEER – we're building a backend that flexibly connects to any data-source (DB or API) and serves 
    it up as if it were our own

  * NOT ACTUALLY AN ENGINEER – loads of our functionality is build using the Stacker platform, 
    so if you love products but can't write code, do we have the job for you!

ago [-]Engineer #1 | Stealth stage analytics company | NYC/Remote
Stealth stage analytics company is looking to bring on Engineer #1. I’ve bootstrapped this business over the last two years and just hit a $1MM run rate.

This is a hands-on role and will allow you to basically own the technology stack and build out the technology team.

A few of the projects you’ll be leading:

- A streaming data pipeline on Kafka handling millions of events a day.

- An open source data integration library that connects data to/from over 75+ of the most common data sources companies rely upon

-A scheduler that deploys thousands of containers a day into Kubernetes clusters, efficiently migrating our customers’ data between systems.

- An open source JavaScript event tracking library

The technology stack is mostly JVM (Java and Scala) with some Python and ES6/React/Redux on the frontend. Everything is containerized and runs on Heroku and Kubernetes.

Candidates should have a mastery of at least one language, and ideally have experience with the following: Docker/Kubernetes, SQL, Kafka, JavaScript, data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery), ETL, data pipelines. Bonus points if you have experience managing engineering teams.

This is a very early position so compensation can be whatever blend of salary/equity you prefer.
Send me an email at slapshothn@gmail.com with a bit about who you are and what you’ve built. If I think there’s a fit, I’ll schedule a Skype/Hangout with you and tell you about the business and discuss the role in more depth.

Podaris is re-inventing how the world plans cities. We're developing a platform for urban infrastructure planning that combines elements of BIM and GIS, with a focus on agile, real-time collaboration.

We’re looking for a full-stack software engineer to join our growing team. You'll be able to make a big impact, joining a small but very enthusiastic team. For this role, you'll primarily focus on mathematical problems: computational geometry, parametric constraint solvers, network routing optimisation, etc -- problems that come up in the course of modeling both physical transport infrastructure and transport network simulation and analysis. However you should be enough of a generalist to be unafraid to dive into other areas of the application where needed.

Technology-wise, Podaris is built on Javascript/ES6, Meteor.js, OpenStreetMap, and OpenLayers. Your expertise with Javascript is more important to us than your experience with the particular libraries that we use. Experience with building large single-page apps is particularly helpful. Experience with Java-based OSM routers (and other associated or similar tooling) is also a strong plus.

We're based in London, UK, but are open to remote workers from anywhere in the world, provided we can establish a collaborative rapport. Currently we can only offer a six-month contract, but will aim to convert that into a salaried role pending additional funding. Equity is also available for extraordinarily talented individuals.

Namebase is a top-level domain registrar and exchange for the Handshake blockchain. Namebase makes it easy for anyone to buy/sell Handshake coins (HNS) and use their HNS to register TLDs.-- Why should you care?
The internet wasn't built to handle the scale it supports today. The DNS we rely on is supported by ducktape solutions that fail to serve the security and reliability needs of today's internet. For instance, compromised Certificate Authorities threaten SSL (https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/certificate-authority-vulner...), and domains get seized for arbitrary reasons, even for good actors (https://twitter.com/zoho/status/1044249648993525760?s=20).
Handshake fixes these issues by letting anyone register secure, censorship-resistant TLDs on the blockchain. More details can be found in the whitepaper https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt.

Namebase is driving adoption of Handshake's DNS by making it easier to use and more powerful.

We are looking for an experienced frontend engineer to join our team of 4 including 2 engineers.

We don't require experience with our tech stack, just the motivation and ability to learn. For more details on the role, email me and I'd love to tell you more - Tieshun, tieshun at namebase.io, Namebase CEO

ago [-]SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 6 months ago I moved to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We’ve hired 3 remote developers so far and it’s been a great experience!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours.
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

Storj develops an open-source, decentralized cloud storage platform called Storj (pronounced storage) that is disrupting the cloud storage market. Rather than storing files in a data center, Storj works by encrypting and partitioning files, then sending the shards to a network of devices contributed by our global community—with active storage nodes on every continent except Antarctica. We rent unused hard drive space from users all over the globe, operating active storage nodes on every continent (except Antarctica). Our core target is selling to software developers and channel partners who get higher quality, privacy, and security at 1/6th the price. We are laying the groundwork for the future of decentralization and web 3.0.

Headquartered in Atlanta, Storj is a global company with North American employees in California, Washington, Utah, Michigan, and Georgia, and European employees in Germany and Bulgaria.

Most of our engineering team sits in Atlanta, where the company was founded. We're in the Atlanta Tech Village, Buckhead. The bulk of our marketing team is in our downtown Salt Lake City office at the Impact Hub co-office building located at 150 S. State Street.

ago [-]Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers...). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Square Cash, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of remote, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but work from anywhere they want.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:
- You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.
- You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.
- You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.
- You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.
- You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
- You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post here or not - we aren't a recruiting firm or job board. We are a home for freelancers/contractors and we have several openings.

Facet Development is a freelancer network made up exclusively of ex-FAANG engineers. Facet does the work of finding freelancing jobs/projects and then we send them out to the devs in the network. We also provide project management and billing/collections, help with taxes, etc, so freelancers get to spend a lot more of their time doing the enjoyable parts of freelancing and not trying to run a small business.

We target FAANG companies and companies that wish they could hire FAANG devs when finding work for our freelancer network. When I was a dev lead at Microsoft, bringing on vendors or outsourcing was a terrible experience, because they always seemed to be below our hiring bar. So I started Facet to solve the problem I had when I was an engineering manager at a FAANG company.

If you are a FAANG or ex-FAANG dev that wants to switch to freelancing or already is, you should join: https://www.facetdev.com/developer-network

We've designed our organization to promote creativity, innovation, and focus on solving some of the hardest challenges in healthcare.

We'd love to talk to you if you're passionate about this domain, and we're especially interested in chatting with you if have experience with healthcare technologies like CDA/CCD/CCDA, PIX, XDS, XCPD, XCA, XDR, HL7, and FHIR.

Submit resumes to resume@careevolution.com

We also invite everyone to build a sample application against our FHIR endpoint.  This small project will give you a taste of what we do at CareEvolution, and will let you demonstrate your skills in a very concrete and relevant way.  We want to stress that doing the challenge is optional, and your hiring chances will not be adversely affected if you elect not to participate.  Work/life fusion is a core value at CareEvolution, and we respect that life circumstances may prevent even awesome candidates from tackling something like this outside of working hours.  We just think it’s a fun way for you to get to know us, and vice-versa.

Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3]

Tanium has a strong engineering culture and takes really good care of it's employees. E.g. team gatherings (3~4/year) leave Monday and Friday open for travel rather than taking half your weekend.

Fortune featured us as one of the Best Small and Medium Workplaces [4], partially based on the Great Place to Work survey, which gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [5].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with base, bonus, and RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.


On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

At Dataquest Labs, we teach data science interactively online to hundreds of thousands of students worldwide. We're focused on teaching skills and building intuition from the ground up with our project based curriculum. Unlike most educational options, we focus on motivating students to learn, not just content delivery. We have students go from little programming or data science knowledge to jobs at companies like SpaceX, Amazon, and Microsoft. You can read about some of the success stories here -- https://www.dataquest.io/stories -- and reviews rom our students here -- https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/dataquest

A key part of our vertically integrated approach to teaching data science is providing a rich environment for learning. Students are always writing code on our platform as they learn new concepts in programming, databases, statistics, data visualization, and machine learning. We're one of a few online learning companies where maintaining and improving our own code running infrastructure is a core competency.

We're looking to hire a Senior Infrastructure Engineer to help us take our infrastructure to the next level. This person will work to empower other backend engineers, help us build a better devops culture, and will have the opportunity to work on deep technical problems at the intersection of backend, devops, and tooling.

On the company side, we're a fully distributed team with people in 5 time zones (4 in the US and 1 in Europe). We're also a profitable, mostly bootstrapped company that prides itself on growing deliberately and empowering students. We hold company offsites 2 to 3 times a year and even enjoy meeting with our students in person at these events.

Here's a preview of the requirements for this position:

* 5+ years of backend infrastructure experience

* 3+ years of Python experience

* Experience with Docker & Kubernetes

* Experience creating on-call rotations

* Experience working on a team with strong devops culture

* A generalist with experience contributing to both backend and infrastructure systems

ago [-]Parse.ly | Growth & Data Lead | Remote | Fully Distributed Team | https://parse.ly
Parse.ly is the web's attention engine. As a measurement layer running across the web, Parse.ly quantifies how visitors respond to online content. Our products are then used by the web's biggest brands and publishers to understand audience attention across the internet in real-time. Our flagship product is Parse.ly Analytics (https://parse.ly/analytics), and is already used by over 400 enterprise customers (https://parse.ly/customers).

But, Parse.ly is just getting started. We just launched Parse.ly Currents (https://parse.ly/currents), a new product that helps people understand internet-wide trends and how content/attention flows online.

As the Growth & Data Lead for Parse.ly, you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, and you want to take a B2B software company out of its successful niche and across the chasm into the broader market. You are comfortable with remote & fully distributed teams. To excel here, you'll work with designers and web developers as collaborators, and be able to leverage data-oriented growth marketing strategies, such as launching search engine optimized public products built atop Parse.ly's data, or important sharing features in our existing sites and products.

You are the kind of person who'd enjoy the books "Hacking Growth", "Traction", "Four Steps to the Epiphany", and "High Growth Handbook". For bonus points, you also care about SaaS enterprise sales. For example, you are the kind of person who enjoyed Dan Pink’s "To Sell is Human".

In this role, you'd run a small team of designers and developers that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s public website, technical documentation, knowledge base, emails/newsletters, data studies, and blog. You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to any of these projects, with a goal of growing sign-ups (and customers) for these products. From a technical standpoint, you'll be data savvy, know some SQL, and be comfortable working with designers/developers, who themselves are comfortable with a modern JavaScript and Python development stack. You'll also use analytics tools like Google Analytics, MixPanel and yes, even, Parse.ly itself, to understand engagement of our visitors, and to position us for more growth in new channels like organic search, social sharing, data-driven press, and free (self-service) data products.

If you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, this job is for you. If you are a former startup founder seeking to relocate to an established startup, but want to continue the path of deploying lean growth techniques, this role may be especially suited for you.

Apply here:

Email work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/projects you think may be relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile. Make sure to mention HN and the "Growth & Data Lead" role. Also, please list your timezone, working hours, and location. Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US/Eastern timezone, due to the timezone makeup of this team.
^ A note on our fully distributed team. The mission of our lean distributed team is described here: https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission. We happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. We expect you to be comfortable with this setup, and collaborating with people primarily over Zoom/GMeet, GitHub, Slack, and email. The cool thing is, this lets you set up your ideal work environment; here's a photograph of mine running two full-screen Parse.ly Analytics dashboards on my monitors: https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73.
