We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.

All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office. All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.

If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. For networks with 20k+ computers, it's the best option by a long shot, and it scales to over a million endpoints without breaking a sweat.

Lt. Gen. Bill Bender, the recently-retired CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [1]

--

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I'll also called out a few positions below.

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, and self directed/unlimited vacation (most folks take 4~5 weeks).

I can't name salary ranges, but my total comp as a remote Senior Software Engineer is about $320k ($165k base, ~$100k bonus, and ~$55k stock).

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.


On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

Remote or on site in Canada, Sweden, or USA.

Our client base is growing steadily and we’re looking for a competent support engineer with exceptional communication skills who can provide enterprise level technical support to our customers via our support system.

Our Support Engineers must know WordPress deeply. All we host is WordPress and we have the best support team in the business (even if we do say so ourselves). While you don't have to be a full-fledged WordPress developer to be a Kinsta Support Engineer, you do need to know the WordPress database and file/directory structure as well as the wp-config.php file like the back of your hand.

A basic understanding of or familiarity with the following technologies is also a must: Linux, Nginx, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DNS, CDN, and caching (object and page).

This is a fully-remote role. Our Support Engineers can work from anywhere they have reliable Internet access. We always use the latest version of everything: PHP 7.2, NGINX, Ubuntu 18.04, Linux containers, Google Cloud and more, so you’ll be able to work with a bunch of exciting technologies and use them every day!

This position offers a great deal of flexibility, responsibility, competitive salary, and opportunity for growth for the right candidate.
