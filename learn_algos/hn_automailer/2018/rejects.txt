It seems unusual for a nonprofit to be able to offer what appear to be market-rate salaries for technical positions. Wonder how they do it. Couldn't find much info on the site about where, exactly, their funding comes from.
I looked at their 2016 Form 990 (most recent available on Guidestar) and it looks like vast majority of funding is from contributions and grants, and revenue exceeds expenses, so that's a good sign.

Hi, I'm an engineer at Thorn. You're right, it is unusual. It's also a big part of our strategy to attract, and keep, top talent. And that goes for talent across the organization: our fundraising, our marketing, our product managers, and our engineers.

META
May I ask you to change the leading text to something more useful for remote workers?

REMOTE doesn't cover but the most basic possibility and 90 matches on this page make it quite cumbersome to find what suits you.

What about deprecating it and requiring posters to use instead:

REMOTE_WORLD - for telecommuting from anywhere in the world

REMOTE_US - for telecommuting from anywhere in the USA

REMOTE_US_TX - for telecommuting from anywhere in Texas, USA

REMOTE_MINUS_6 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC-6 timezone, standard time

REMOTE_PLUS_1 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC+1 timezone, standard time

Example: In the past, I telecommuted to Boston (US-MA) from Barcelona (ES). That job would have been advertised as "REMOTE_MINUS_5, REMOTE_WORLD". In fact I worked 3pm-11pm in ES (i.e. 9am-5pm in US-MA), which was certainly unusual but quite doable nonetheless.

Sr. Software Engineer @ Kinetica (Machine Learning & Distributed Systems) https://goo.gl/MnZ9ug
Kinetica seeks a Senior Software Engineer with Python and Distributed Systems experience. The Senior Software Engineer will be joining an accomplished team to help build out a green-field project -- a new product line for our company.

Our team of engineers is building out a scalable, distributed machine learning and data science platform with tight integrations and pipelines to a distributed, sharded GPU-powered database. This means the product would need to be developed in Linux and operate inside containers (Docker for us), work in a container-orchestrated environment (Kubernetes for us), operate in a scalable resource managed system (GPUs via Kubernetes) and interact with complex analytical systems (TensorFlow, etc.) Some of this, you’ll already be familiar with, and some of it we’ll learn along the way.

The Senior Software Engineer would work closely with the Product Owner to build out the product in Python and integrate all other parts (TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and our GPU-powered DB) using Python bindings to build and deliver an overall product (a REST API.) This role focuses on the backend and will interface with our front-end engineers who will write a ReactJS application atop the REST API.

Deep Learning Retreat | Senior Resident mentor | Fremont, CA | Full-time | https://deeplearningretreat.com/
Deep learning Retreat (DLR) is the first deep learning school in the world. We train people who want to either:

- Have a job in a tech company

- Have tons of impact by going alone on their own startup or doing ‘good’

We make sure we fulfill those two customer needs by giving them the best environment to produce an impressive portfolio project.

The more we talk to companies interviewing today, the more apparent it is: A portfolio project is decisive when making hiring judgments. Jeremy Howard recommends it. Andrew Ng recommends it. Why? It’s far better at discriminating talent than any other proxy (CVs don’t work; pedigree doesn’t work; puzzles don’t work). DLR focus is to help you write the best portfolio project you could; in that sense, it’s like a writer’s retreat, where one goes to finish your masterpiece novel. We use online videos to cover the theory, but focus on project-based, peer-learning methods that are completely hands on. When you come out of the door, you should be holding a project that proves you can write damn good code and makes you unstoppable in interviews… or an extremely desirable partner for social impact projects or startups.

Brex (brex.com) | San Francisco, CA | On-site only | Full-time | Visa
What we bring:

- An environment where it matters to make the right design decisions the first time. "Move fast and break things" doesn't really work for the type of system that we build. We take less technical debt than other companies.

- At Brex, engineers make the product decisions with input from business people, instead of business / product people making decisions with input from engineers

- We'd rather have one strong, well-compensated engineer instead of having 5 mediocre engineers. Our customers are fine with fewer features, but are not ok with broken features.

- Small, accountable and autonomous teams of amazing people, eager to learn, teach and constantly improve our way of working.

- We believe that great individual contributors generate as much (or more!) value as engineering managers, and we compensate them accordingly.

What you'll bring:

- Exceptional technical background.

- Strong sense of ownership and accountability for what you're building. What you build today will be the foundation for dozens of other systems in the future.

- Frankness on discussing technical matters. If you disagree with how things are being done, we encourage you to speak up. You can attack an idea without attacking the person behind it.

- Passion for code. We love people that take pride in and love programming, especially if they've done so since a very young age.

- Experience in Haskell, Scala, Functional Programming, Elixir or F# is a plus

Does Brex sound like home? We'd love to meet you: https://jobs.lever.co/brex/befd063b-976e-4bb1-835f-e4564dee4...

BBOXX | Software Engineer | London | Onsite
BBOXX provides affordable energy to off grid customers in sub-Saharan Africa using an innovative IOT based solar kit combined with cashless digital payments. We are looking for experienced developers to maintain and break our back-office solution into focused micro services.

Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071

About BBOXX

Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.

BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.

Location: We're only filling full-time on-site (SF, CA) roles at the moment.

University of Pennsylvania | Philadelphia, PA | ONSITE | https://www.waytohealth.org/
Way to Health is a patient engagement and research platform which has been used to power over 100 research studies and clinical programs improving the health of our patients. As just one example, the Heart Safe Motherhood program uses our platform to text postpartum mothers about their blood pressure for 10 days, allowing us to catch mothers at risk for preeclampsia long before they would otherwise show up in an ambulance.

As we scale from research to clinical and commercial use, the Software Developers on our team play a critical role in extending and supporting the platform - designing and building new features to enable novel patient engagement strategies, improving the user interface for our patients and providers, and troubleshooting issues affecting our users.

This position requires strong technical ability to design and build web applications and APIs, clear communication with team members and users to deeply understand user needs, and creativity to solve issues and meet requirements while paying off rather than accruing technical debt.

Bachelors degree and minimum 3 years experience in web development required. We use mostly PHP and Vue.js so experience in either of those is a plus, but we will consider candidates with experience in other backend or frontend frameworks. An interest in medicine, research, and/or patient engagement is always great - we are an excited and engaged team who loves what we do and the impact that we can make.

Divvy Homes | Sr. Software Engineer (full-stack) | (ONSITE) San Francisco, CA | www.divvyhomes.com
The Gist

At Divvy, we're helping renters become homeowners by letting our customers buy back pieces of their home over time. Our goal is for our customers to accrue enough equity in their homes to use as a down payment for a traditional mortgage.

The Company

Over the past year, we’ve worked hard to build an exceptional team, raise over $30 million in funding, and provide homes for dozens of families, meaningfully changing their financial future. Our customers choose any home for sale, and Divvy buys it on their behalf. The customer leases the home back from us while building equity credits along the way, preparing to buy the home at the end of their lease. Our customers get to live in their future home today, while buying fractions of the home over time.

The Job

We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer passionate about using their creativity and talent to make access to homeownership more accessible. In this role, you’ll be part of the engineering team building our consumer, agent and administrative products. At Divvy, you’ll own your projects from start to finish and help to scale our platform to thousands of new applicants and multiple new markets. You’ll report directly to Divvy’s CTO and work alongside a team of 3-5 software engineers.

Apply directly at: https://angel.co/divvy-homes/jobs/375496-software-engineer-f....

Dahlia Lights | Mobile Engineer | Bay Area, CA | Full Time | Onsite | http://www.dahlialights.com
Dahlia Lights is building the first computer vision enabled lighting companion. Our sensing module is installed in a corner and works with smart lights like Philips Hue to map a room and its lighting. With this information we automatically generate a range of lighting scenes for your favorite activities. It’s like having your very own lighting designer! We can also detect presence so your lights will turn on when you enter a room, and only turn off once you leave. You can also set up your lights to change depending on what’s going on in a room. For example, you can set your lights to fade into a reading mode when you sit in your favorite reading chair at night.

Job Description As a Mobile Engineer at Dahlia Lights, you will be a core member of the engineering team defining and building a new kind of lighting product that will bring great joy to people’s lives. Since you will be an early member of the team, you will need to learn quickly while contributing to the product and company in many ways. You will have a lot of freedom and say in defining the technologies and features we develop.

Your focus will be on developing our mobile app using React Native. This includes developing the UI, the front-end architecture, and working with smart product APIs. Ideally, you will also be able to help out with other engineering problems such as maintaining back-end services and databases. Our mobile app is the main way our users interact with our product, making it an incredibly important component to the product experience. A focus on user experience with an attention to detail is incredibly important.

Our tech stack: React, Vue, and GraphQL on the front end, Ruby on Rails on the back with some Node+typescript. Postgres database, hosted on AWS. Mostly python on our ML side. Looking for very smart engineers who want to build a unique web app whose end users are in the same room as you.

Laws are the operating system on top of which all businesses operate. Without legal infrastructure, businesses and individuals would not be able to transact with trust that their counterparties will be held accountable. This trust has set the stage for a high degree of economic growth in America, and as laws have become more complex over time, interpreting and advising on the law has become an increasingly specialized profession.

Along with the law, regulation has also increased as a mechanism to assure the quality of legal professionals. Consequently, a massive legal industry has risen, and navigating the law has become an opaque, slow, and expensive process. Because of the regulatory hurdles in forming startup law firms, competition in providing legal services is soft, and technology and process improvements for clients do not happen as quickly as in other industries. Today, business managers do not have transparency into legal projects, and often view legal as a blocker to the goals they want to accomplish.

Atrium’s vision is to democratize and organize enterprises’ access to legal data, legal advice, and legal work. We will achieve this vision by combining the expertise of a full service law firm with the technology development processes and growth ambitions of Silicon Valley. This will enable transparent, fast, and cost competitive legal services for corporations.

Atrium has the potential to be a hugely impactful company that brings corporate legal services to the 21st century.

Tempo Automation | Full-Stack Software Engineer | SF | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://www.tempoautomation.com
Tempo operates a factory in SF to produce printed circuit boards extremely quickly - in doing so, we give our customers the physical equivalent of a fast compiler, enabling them to turn their designs into real products significantly faster than they could before. Our customers build rockets, drones, medical devices, and much more - working at Tempo means you can accelerate all of these industries at once. Providing a system to produce circuit boards quickly and correctly means we're both a software shop and an advanced manufacturer. Our software team is still pretty small (9 engineers) which means any new hires will still have an outsize impact on the direction of our technology, and on the company as a whole. We love hiring strong generalists [python experience highly preferred] who take initiative and act as part-time PMs when they're working on projects. Some projects you might work on: - Offering real-time, automated manufacturing feedback based on certain parameters of our customers' designs. Think linting for hardware.

  - Optimizing our factory processes with machine learning and scheduling algorithms.

  - Encoding the three-dimensional structure of each order's components (e.g. resistors, capacitors) for our assembly robots, in order to speed up assembly and ensure minimal manufacturing defects.

  - Optimizing our automated optical inspection machine to make it faster than any in the industry.
Tech Stack: Python | Django | React | Redux | PostgreSQL | AWS
We're also excited to be moving into a MUCH larger factory (>4x the floor space) in SoMa in a couple months, which means you'll see that space evolve from nothing into an enormous, high-tech manufacturing complex. If you're interested, please apply at https://www.tempoautomation.com/careers or send a note to austin [at] tempoautomation [dot] com.

Haplo | London | ONSITE | Graduate Software Engineer
Are you graduating this summer? Haplo will help you get the best possible start to your career as a software developer.

https://haplo-services.com/jobs/new-graduates

Every year, new graduates join our team, and they ship working features to our clients within their first two weeks. We support their growth in a direction which suits them, whether that's a focus on writing code, taking a client-facing role, or developing a particular specialism.

We can do this because we've really thought about how to build a team, and a way of developing software, that can enable someone at the beginning of their career to realise their potential as quickly as they can.

Joining us will give you a wide range of experience across the full software development lifecycle, and you'll make an important contribution to your team.

You'll be building hosted products used by universities to manage their research:

* PhD Manager is our market leading system to manage PhD programmes, helping everyone work together and PhD researchers to complete their doctorate.

* Ethics Monitor enables universities to ensure that all research is safe and ethical.

* Haplo Research Manager brings together the full lifecycle of research, from the start of the project to the publication of results.

Our products are written on top of our open source platform, designed for building applications which manage large amounts of semi-structured data with a polished user experience.

While ideal, a computer science degree isn't essential, as long as you've written software as part of your degree or outside your studies. You'll mainly be working in server-side JavaScript, but don't need to have used this before.

Haplo is an equal opportunities employer, and our inclusive team welcomes colleagues from all backgrounds: https://haplo-services.com/about/who

You must have a right to work in the UK.

numo | Mobile Software Engineer (Flutter) | Pittsburgh, PA | Full-time | REMOTE possible but ONSITE preferred
http://jobs.numo.com/apply/fLLTgs8Xzu/Mobile-Software-Engine...

At numo (https://www.numo.com), we create and incubate new "fintech" companies. We have the good fortune of starting from a clean slate (i.e., no legacy code) and are able to use the latest and greatest frameworks and tools.

We are actively working on our first product, a banking app for the freelance/gig economy workforce. We've chosen to use Flutter as our mobile framework and are ideally looking for someone with actual Flutter experience. Given it is a new framework, we are of course willing to talk to folks with real world mobile experience on iOS and/or Android (hopefully both).

Our backend is Scala/Akka running at AWS.

Our strong preference is to have an on-site developer, but we are willing to contemplate remote arrangements for exceptional candidates. In this case, travel to our Pittsburgh headquarters would be required (and frequent in the beginning).

If interested, please apply using link above - I review the applications personally. Please note in the cover letter you saw this in Hacker News.

IPUMS | ipums.org | Data Engineer | Minneapolis, MN | Onsite | Full-Time
IPUMS is a leader in the field of quantitative social science research and the largest disseminator of census and demographic data to the world’s academic research community. Or, to put it another way - we’re on a mission to gather, process, link and publish billions of records spanning hundreds of years and more than 100 countries to demographers, historians, economists, environmental scientists, journalists, policymakers, and others around the globe, who then use the data to do amazing research and make the world a better place.

We are currently seeking a software developer to join our data linking team that is working on large scale data manipulation and creating highly performant distributed software systems. In this role, you will be developing software that links records representing the same individual and their family relationships across every US Census from 1850 - 1940. There are no consistent identifiers across historical censuses, so sophisticated matching algorithms will be required. You will be building on research and IT effort from the past decade to create a dataset that, once released, will enable critical new avenues of research for demographers and historians. This work will also lead to additional data linking opportunities for datasets from around the world and throughout history. You will be working in close collaboration with expert historians, demographers, and data scientists. We use Apache Spark (PySpark and SparkSQL) for a majority of our data processing, with C++ in critical areas. This is an excellent opportunity to grow your career with a cutting -edge software shop at the University of Minnesota and contribute to work that has impact around the globe.

Required Skills: BA/BS degree required. Two years of work experience in the areas of application/web/systems development with a related BA/BS degree, or four years of work experience in the areas of application/web/systems development with a non-related BA/BS degree.

This role requires technical experience and proficiency with:

- Experience developing software for high performance and/or distributed computing

- Experience with databases (relational or NoSQL)

- Large dataset manipulation

- Linux/UNIX operating systems, including command-line

See https://www.ipums.org/data-engineer for more details and instructions on how to apply.

Knotel | multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://knotel.com
Knotel is a fast growing real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.

Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.

As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.

In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to solve.

We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.

Today we're hiring a whole bunch of roles:

- Lead Full Stack Engineer https://grnh.se/91ad31da1 - Data Engineer https://grnh.se/d5c41fd31 - Data Analyst https://grnh.se/9b5847e81 - Senior DevOps Engineer https://grnh.se/e43371b81 - Full Stack Engineers (job post coming soon, in the meantime email me)

NoRedInk | Back-End, Front-End, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE | $300k+ total comp
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. For networks with 20k+ computers, it's the best option by a long shot, and it scales to over a million endpoints without breaking a sweat.

Lt. Gen. Bill Bender, the recently-retired CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [1]

--

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I'll also called out a few positions below.

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, and self directed/unlimited vacation (most folks take 4~5 weeks).

I can't name salary ranges, but my total comp as a remote Senior Software Engineer is about $320k ($165k base, ~$100k bonus, and ~$55k stock).

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.

On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

USC Information Sciences Institute | Research Programmer | Waltham, MA | Marina del Rey, CA | REMOTE | Full-time | isi.edu
The University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute (ISI) is one of the nation’s largest, most successful university-affiliated computer research institutes. ISI’s VISTA center (https://www.isi.edu/centers/vista/overview) performs research in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, biometrics, optical character recognition (OCR), and speech and text analytics. Much of our software is open-source and we publish in top conferences.

Some of our current and upcoming projects include:

- Creation of a new Python open source information extraction toolkit to enable reasoning and experimentation using diverse document interpretations

- Detecting and counteracting social engineering attacks

- Construction of knowledge bases from text, images, audio, and video which can represent multiple hypotheses about the state of the world

- Automatic extraction of events, entities, and causal and temporal relations between them (who did what to whom, when, and why?) from text

- Improving cross-language information retrieval (searching for English concepts in foreign-language documents) for text in low-resource languages (e.g. Swahili, Tagalog)

- Automatic generation of fictional stories

As a part of our team, you’d help execute these and other research projects. Key requirements are the ability to learn new technologies rapidly and to communicate technical ideas clearly.

Open positions:

- For junior software engineers/new graduates with a background or interest in NLP: https://usccareers.usc.edu/job/waltham/research-programmer-i... (Waltham, MA)

- For early-career software engineers with a background or interest in NLP: https://usccareers.usc.edu/job/waltham/research-programmer-i... (Waltham, MA)

- For experienced generalist software engineers, no NLP background required: https://usccareers.usc.edu/job/waltham/research-programmer-i... (Waltham, MA; Marina del Rey, CA; or remote within US)

Spot hero requires a coding challenge. It's not a small one either; it's like 2+ days of work. I said I had a ton of open source stuff on Github, some doing more complex stuff than their assignment and if they could just look at that.
They refused.

I no longer do pro-interview requirements for free. Maybe if I got a $300 gift card.

Please don't interview here. Don't work for free!!

This breaks the rule at the top which asks you not to reply to job posts to complain about something. We're in no position to adjudicate such complaints, nor are these threads a good place for companies to reply, or for the community to discuss or work anything out.

This keeps being repeated as if it's somehow obvious or undisputed, but it's not, nor is the actual "good place" for such a discussion ever indicated.

Previously, you've also mentioned that the rule isn't designed to be strictly fair in some way, but, generally, better for HN overall. In what way? That is, by what mechanism is it better? What downside are you trying to avoid?

Where was this dicussed and/or decided? What's the reasoning behind it? Is the decision based on facts or conjecture?

djsumdog 10 days ago [-]

It is up there in the rules. I'm sure I've read it in the past and probably forgot about it. Now that I've been hit by it I'll remember.
But I see your point for sure. HN is heavily moderated and I've watched good discussions simply go away. I've come to accept that as just being par the course for HN.

Maybe the right forum would be GlassDoor?

It wasn't always, and it's quite an exceptional standard, compared to the rest of the site.

> Maybe the right forum would be GlassDoor?

Unfortunately, Glassdoor has no facility for discussion.

Moreover, HN mods haven't come out and stated outright that this category of conversation isn't welcome anywhere on HN, though the implicit global censoriship is hard to ignore.

BookMyScan | https://bookmyscan.co.uk | Cambridge / London, UK | REMOTE (Europe) | Full-time | Python/Django/PostgreSQL | Senior Full Stack Developer | £40-£50k
I am the CTO at BookMyScan, and we develop online booking systems for diagnostic scans. We have a number of exciting opportunities, and therefore need to expand the development team.

I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.

Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day. I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.

Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.

We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.

Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.
