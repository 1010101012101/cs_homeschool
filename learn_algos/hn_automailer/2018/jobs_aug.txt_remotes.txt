CCAT-prime Telescope | Toronto | Developer | Full-time | ONSITE | https://ccatp.ca
We're building a 6-meter diameter telescope on a mountain in Chile's Atacama Desert to learn more about how stars form, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, neutrino masses, and the big bang.

The telescope will be shared by multiple instruments, and our group is building the joint software infrastructure: services for controlling the telescope, moving data around, monitoring, alerting, logging, etc.

Stack is still being decided but likely a mix of Go, Python, Redis, Postgres, etc. The telescope site is remote and hostile -- altitude of 5600m in the driest desert on Earth -- so we're focused on fault-tolerance.

https://utoronto.taleo.net/careersection/10000/jobdetail.ftl...

(It's listed as a one-year position, but we expect it to last at least 3-4 years)

Email jobs@ccatp.ca if you have any questions.

Is the US/Canada restriction on remote for financial or time zone reasons (or both?)?

I'm in Mexico. And yes I find that distinction weird and arbitrary. There's a lot of "Remote OK but USA and Canada only" posts in this list. I'm sure there's a very good reason that has nothing to do with discrimination but… well, that wouldn't be surprising either.

META
May I ask you to change the leading text to something more useful for remote workers?

REMOTE doesn't cover but the most basic possibility and 90 matches on this page make it quite cumbersome to find what suits you.

What about deprecating it and requiring posters to use instead:

REMOTE_WORLD - for telecommuting from anywhere in the world

REMOTE_US - for telecommuting from anywhere in the USA

REMOTE_US_TX - for telecommuting from anywhere in Texas, USA

REMOTE_MINUS_6 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC-6 timezone, standard time

REMOTE_PLUS_1 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC+1 timezone, standard time

Example: In the past, I telecommuted to Boston (US-MA) from Barcelona (ES). That job would have been advertised as "REMOTE_MINUS_5, REMOTE_WORLD". In fact I worked 3pm-11pm in ES (i.e. 9am-5pm in US-MA), which was certainly unusual but quite doable nonetheless.

Williams PanLab for Precision Psychiatry and Translational Neuroscience | Research Data Analyst and Engineer | Stanford, CA; Remote possible | Full-time, Visa | http://williamspanlab.com/
The PanLab for Precision Psychiatry and Translational Neuroscience is searching for a Research Data Analyst and Engineer to build and improve upon our treatment prediction software pipeline, which will help guide an individual to the depression/anxiety treatment that is most effective for them. Our pipeline is the first of its kind and currently outputs the different ways brain circuitry can become dysfunctional. The candidate will use machine learning and statistical techniques in our large datasets to analyze the outputs of our current pipeline and create new treatment prediction models.

The PanLab is a research group at Stanford University that aims to use brain imaging to improve our understanding and treatment of mental health conditions. Our current projects focus on depression and anxiety, with research that embraces individual differences. We use a variety of tools such as MRI, EEG, behavioral testing, genetics, symptoms, and daily functioning data, in order to match an individual with the best treatment for them, whether that is an antidepressant, psychotherapy, TMS, lifestyle changes, etc.

We are looking for a candidate with strong data analysis and software engineering experience, but no neuroimaging experience is required! As we are a 30-person team of psychiatrists, neuroscientists, doctors, clinical psychologists, and data scientists, the ability to communicate technical ideas across a range of experiences is vital. Most importantly, we seek someone self-motivated, imaginative, and genuinely excited to dig into our datasets and to explore novel, reliable, and effective ways to help individuals suffering from mental illness.

We're motivated by making developers' lives easier. We want to see people spend time on what makes their app unique and interesting, not on packaging. We also understand that developers currently face an impossible choice between few updates to lower the risk of breakage and frequent updates to lower the risk of compromise.

It needs to integrate deep into Python, Node, Ruby, Electron, and others so that releasing your app for tens of millions of Linux users is a natural extension of setup.py or npm run.

Giftly | REMOTE | Full-stack engineer | www.giftly.com
This is a unique opportunity: you can live anywhere in the world and work whenever you want as long as you stay coordinated with the team, deliver high-quality code, and consistently meet deadlines. This is a good role for someone who has solid experience and wants to take on significant responsibility in order to enjoy that flexibility.

About Giftly: Giftly is a successful e-commerce startup that has grown from a VC-backed seed round in 2011 into a profitable company.

The core Giftly service is a fairly mature gift card service, with hundreds of thousands of users and millions of dollars being processed annually. We are working on launching a brand new gift card product that will run alongside the existing service.

The role: We are searching for an experienced full-stack engineer to play a crucial role in both maintaining the core service and developing this new product. In this role, you will be responsible for front-end and back-end development and deployment infrastructure.

The CTO, who’s been with the company for over 5 years, will be a resource for institutional knowledge, collaboration, and problem-solving, but you’ll be encouraged and empowered to make your own architecture and implementation decisions. You will get to own the application and be involved in key product strategy decisions and setting high-level priorities.

We're a London based consultancy who work mainly with Django.

We're looking for a full stack developer to join us, ideally permanently but will consider freelance too. Primarily you'll be working on our client sites maintaining and developing Django web applications and mobile APIs, but also working on some of our own products and open source projects (https://github.com/wildfish/).

Everyone in our organisation is technical, all of us working remotely, although it's handy if you're within distance of London for meetings occasionally. We're ideally looking for someone in the UK, but will possibly consider someone overseas with excellent English in a similar timezone. Some of the things we use, which it would be good for you to know some of:

- Python/Django [Essential]

- HTML/CSS/Javascript [Essential]

- Twitter Bootstrap

- React / React Native

- PostgreSQL

- Ubuntu Linux Server Admin

- Docker

- AWS, GCE, Kubernetes

The most important thing is that you must be passionate about your craft, and eager to share and learn with others who feel the same. You'll need to be able to work autonomously, so it's important that you're the sort of person who has attention to detail and can be self motivated.

Please email work@wildfish.com, including the salary or rate you're looking for, along with a list of 3 Django apps you like to use in projects, and a link to any code you have available online. Please also mention if you have any interest in cryptocurrency.

Thanks :)

We build strong relationships with our clients, contractors, and employees and we believe that this is fundamental to doing great work. As a Truss engineer you will facilitate bringing Truss values (https://truss.works/values/) to those truly trying to make a difference in our government, and enable them to understand what their citizens actually need rather than implementing a perceived solution.

Here are some of the things we care about: * Great communication! Including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing * The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy * Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools * Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc. * Experience deploying at least one application that other people use * Have held at least one engineering position post-education * Initiative, curiosity, a bias for action, and a problem-solving attitude

We expect all Truss engineers to consistently develop new skills, and cross-train into new disciplines outside of their current areas of expertise.

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations.

Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parser generators, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

numo | Mobile Software Engineer (Flutter) | Pittsburgh, PA | Full-time | REMOTE possible but ONSITE preferred
http://jobs.numo.com/apply/fLLTgs8Xzu/Mobile-Software-Engine...

At numo (https://www.numo.com), we create and incubate new "fintech" companies. We have the good fortune of starting from a clean slate (i.e., no legacy code) and are able to use the latest and greatest frameworks and tools.

We are actively working on our first product, a banking app for the freelance/gig economy workforce. We've chosen to use Flutter as our mobile framework and are ideally looking for someone with actual Flutter experience. Given it is a new framework, we are of course willing to talk to folks with real world mobile experience on iOS and/or Android (hopefully both).

Our backend is Scala/Akka running at AWS.

Our strong preference is to have an on-site developer, but we are willing to contemplate remote arrangements for exceptional candidates. In this case, travel to our Pittsburgh headquarters would be required (and frequent in the beginning).

If interested, please apply using link above - I review the applications personally. Please note in the cover letter you saw this in Hacker News.

Tasks are very varied, from developing core platform features, custom exercises and tools for specific courses (XBlocks), customizing and deploying instances, working fullstack, operating our service infrastructure, improving our hosting platform, etc. You won't get bored here.

Most of your work is published as free software (Open edX is released under the AGPL license, which requires clients to release modifications under the same license), and you would also contribute to the free software project, pushing most of your developments upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation or help on mailing-lists.

Worldwide, REMOTE, full time or part time -- 100% flexibility. $70-100/hr. Expert Interviewer at Karat (https://karat.io)
Work from anywhere in the world that has a solid internet connection. Work as much or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours -- you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else the training/time investment doesn't make as much sense from your end or ours.

I know the above might sound a little strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers' time interviewing; we help take the load off. We've done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we're well-funded and growing quickly as a result.

Because of this quickly-growing demand, we're looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you're strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.

Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather's like.

The application form is here: https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...

I know it's a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I'm happy to talk through any of it.

P.S. We're also hiring for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior engineers right now; for those we generally prefer local (Seattle) candidates, though we do cover relocation. More details on those here: https://karat.io/careers, or feel free to email me if you have any questions.

NeoSmart Technologies | full and part-time positions | REMOTE only
NeoSmart Technologies is the world leader in disaster recovery. We've reverse engineered the entire Windows bootup procedure from BIOS POST to the login screen [0], and have developed automated tools to rebuild the entire thing from scratch with nary a user intervention: https://neosmart.net/EasyRE/

We're also the authors of the wildly famous EasyBCD [1] bootloader modification freeware, and numerous other system-related utilities. We fully embrace all types of technology, and ship code written in C, C++, C#, Rust, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more.

We are currently hiring for the following positions:

1) Researchers with a knack for experimentation and writing to expand our wiki of system errors by purposely breaking Windows virtual machines and then seeing what it takes to fix them. Example: https://neosmart.net/wiki/ntldr-is-missing/ and https://neosmart.net/wiki/ntdetect-failed/

The findings of your feedback would be used to both improve the automated repair process of tools like EasyRE and to directly benefit others searching for solutions online.

2) ASP.NET Core full-stack developers

We have a number of legacy ASP.NET MVC projects we would like to port to ASP.NET Core as well as new ASP.NET Core-based projects with frontends written in plain CSS/HTML + TypeScript (so not react or vue.js-based). These include our online ecommerce platforms, custom cms, software hosting system, and more.

3) C# developers with XAML design experience

We are looking to port a number of legacy .NET Framework 2.0 apps to either WPF or UWP, and are looking for talented desktop software developers to help us make the switch. We also have a number of open-source NuGet packages that need some love, including further documentation.

Email me if you're interested. mqudsi@neosmart.net

NoRedInk | Back-End, Front-End, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE | $300k+ total comp
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. For networks with 20k+ computers, it's the best option by a long shot, and it scales to over a million endpoints without breaking a sweat.

Lt. Gen. Bill Bender, the recently-retired CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [1]

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I'll also called out a few positions below.

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, and self directed/unlimited vacation (most folks take 4~5 weeks).

I can't name salary ranges, but my total comp as a remote Senior Software Engineer is about $320k ($165k base, ~$100k bonus, and ~$55k stock).

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.


On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day. I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.

Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.

We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.

Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.
