      Microsoft | Consultants, Architects, Software Engineers, and everything else| REMOTE, INTERNS, WORLDWIDE
Microsoft is recruiting across all technical roles. Our engineering roles are primarily located in the major tech hubs (Seattle/Redmond, Bay Area, Boston, London, etc...), but we also have a large remote "field" doing application development work in consulting, highly advanced technical support, and technical sales support.

We write code and provide advice that delivers the largest, most complex and strategic implementations of Microsoft technologies for external customers. As we are a distributed organization, at least 50% travel is expected. Recruiting is being conducted broadly across all technical stacks. If you are a great developer and eager to learn new technologies or platforms, we want to talk to you.

Example projects include: developing blockchain based inventory control systems, tracking biological pathogens, reinventing an organization's recruiting platform and process, developing massive IoT telemetry ingestion platforms, and building media delivery platforms for some of the biggest sporting events in the world.
You can reach out to me directly by going to https://aka.ms/AppsHnRecruit or you can apply to Microsoft at https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en
                      
                  
      Of all companies, I never expected Microsoft to be remote friendly. Nice.I worked there for a long time as a Senior Developer. I certainly wouldn't call it remote friendly unless you have a manager willing to fight for your ability to work remote.We are hiring for field (consulting, support, tech sales/architecture and some customer facing engineering) positions remotely, with varying degrees of travel. Core engineering teams are still largely on Prem, although I’ve been delivering software on the consulting side so long I’m a bit out of touch there.If this is the division I am part of, there are definitely remote friendly roles available.  The nature of the role will impact travel.  My current role balance is about 25% travel, 30-50% coding, the remainder mentoring, design, etc.Any Engineering positions REMOTE?Core engineering, not really, although Xamarin might be an exception. Customer facing engineering, consulting, support engineering, and other field based software dev roles are primarily distributed, with varying degrees of travel. Ive been doing application development in the consulting services wing for quite a while now, so I’m a bit out of touch with the product engineering groups.Hi Chris, thanks for posting. Just reached out to you via HN form. Cheers!United States Digital Service | Senior Software Engineers, Senior Site Reliability Engineers, Senior Designers, and more! | Washington, DC | ONSITE https://www.usds.gov/
The best of technology. The best of government. And we want you. We're looking for the most tenacious designers, software engineers, product managers, and more, who are committed to untangling, rewiring and redesigning critical government services. You'll join a team of the most talented technologists from across the private sector and government. No government resume required! We work on some of the biggest issues affecting the American people there are, immigration, veterans service, students, health care, and more. We're especially looking for talented senior engineers to join us to help shift move government tech in the right direction.

See one of our Reports to Congress for examples of what you could be working on:

      We've got a lot of impactful projects to work on. It turns out that government systems/technology need a lot of help, and USDS is well-positioned to assist.I applaud you for what you're doing. I also know you've heard this 100 times Matt, but maybe it'll be the 101st time that makes the decisions makers allow this. Allow remote.This country spans a large area & a lot of it is full of people who would love to help their country do better, but few want to move to DC. The US "Digital" Service should be a shining example to others of how to work remotely.
                      
                  
      I hear you. Right now a lot of our meetings involve sitting with or across from decision makers, and being in DC is really critical for that.For what it's worth, some of our individual agency engagements (e.g. VA or DoD) might allow you to come to DC for a short while like three months and then work remotely after that. But most of our work is in DC, at least for now.
                      
                  
      If that was something you promoted for the summer months when school is out & one could bring their family with, I think you would have a lot of takers.Best wishes!
                      
                  
      Just keep senior people there as code reviewers and 'account managers' who would sit down with stakeholders from DC. Then open source some of the other projects or at least add approved citizens that could work remotely on low-security projects. (Like some of the commenters above).I’ve said it to you before, and I’ll say it again, thank you for your service Matt. Listened to you on the TWiT network and have followed your career ever since.
I’m on vacation this week, and while my wife reads, I spelunk data in the US Census and American Community Survey. I’ve been looking this week at polling proximity for voters based on demographics and RUCA coding, to see how fair access is to voting throughout the country. I’ve had to primarily use third party data sources because the government datasets are poor or non existent (thanks to Census Reporter, Google Civic API, and Google Distance Matrix API).

I hope other engineers like yourself take the challenge and seek to improve our technology. We need it, and it’s important!
Thanks again Matt.
                      
                  
      It sounds like your current gig would keep you 100% busy, but if timing or life changes might allow for you to come do a tour, it sounds you've been bit by the same civic bug as us!Definitely. Maybe need to get Google to buy my startup and I’ll go spend a couple years in service :)
If I’m ever in DC I’ll reach out. Would love to take a tour and learn more.
Best of luck to you and the team, Matt. Email is in my profile if I can ever be of assistance.
                      
                  
      Is USDS doing any work with the IRS? I'm currently working at a tax policy think tank, and from what I can see I think the IRS could definitely use help on a number of fronts. Probably the biggest thing: they've got to finish rewriting their tax filing system to not be in assembly--don't know if they've made good progress on getting it into Java. Their SOI data could also use a better system for hosting/distribution along the lines of data.gov.We have done some work with the IRS in the past, such as https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/irs-secure-acce...We don't currently have an engagement at the IRS/Treasury, but if we get more people to sign up, that would increase the odds. :)
                      
                  
      Just FYI the IRS is hiring directly. I keep seeing them advertising open software engineering positions in Austin, TX, though I'm uncertain about other locations.Please don’t help the irs.Are you Libertarian or do you have a non-partisan objection to the IRS specifically?In my experience, "starving the beast" just means you're locked in a room with a starving beast. Bureaucracies can be awful to deal with. But if you strip them of resources, the laws that dictate their mission are unchanged. Any hope of expedient resolution of issues is gone. People who, often through no choice of their own, must deal with these bureaucracies will receive worst treatment and outcomes. Unpopular though the IRS may be, an IRS that can't function correctly is more dangerous to individuals and society than one that can.I'm struggling to think of any legitimate objection to the IRS that could be non-partisan.It's always been my daydream to work with a company like this and serve my country.At my current job I joined because it directly helps people as well by helping them shed off debt they cannot handle. We all do what we can to help others. Kudos to you!
                      
                  
      That's important! We have done some work on that around student loans: https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/what-if-you-could...If you're interested, consider applying!
                      
                  
      It's too bad that there aren't intern positions. Lots of DC students would be interested I'm sure.You might want to check out https://www.fedscoop.com/civic-digital-fellows-demo-day-2018... if you're looking for that!Any nontechnical roles ever come up? I'm at the e-Residency program in Estonia leading a team but definitely want to come back to the States and serve at some pointMost of our work involves engineers, designers, and product managers. Under the product category, there's also the notion of a "bureaucracy hacker" who helps get things done and launched. Those folks might not always be super technical, but are good at pushing to make forward progress.I am impressed with the work your team is doing!Has the current administration changed the work/mission/culture at all?We work on non-partisan projects, and the way we prioritize projects hasn't changed. So we're still able to get important things done for Veterans, small businesses, doctors/patients, students, immigrants, soldiers, etc.This is a recent overview of the sort of projects that we're working on: https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2017/fall/ It's all great stuff that you'd feel proud to tell your family and friends about.
                      
                  
      > We work on non-partisan projects
As the existence and prioritization of executive branch projects is an outcome of partisan politics, that's only even possibly true in the sense that some government projects, even in this administration, aren't particularly subject to partisan controversy.
But while it would be possibly true in that sense, it doesn't seem to be actually true in that sense, as a review of the highlight projects at https://www.usds.gov/work shows that many serve goals that have been the subject of intense partisan controversy over the last couple years.
                      
                  
      This is interesting. I’m a veteran and know first hand how terrible the system can be.
I’ve taight myself JavaScript and have recently learned Django with my current position. I don’t have any plans to leave the company now, but working on systems that can help out fellow veterans more easily is tempting.
Maybe in a year or two I’ll revisit this :)
                      
                  
      You might consider applying. We're well-positioned to improve things at Veterans Affairs. I've had a Veteran say "I had trouble deciding about my GI Bill benefits. I'd like to build a tool to make it easier for other Veterans." And then they did!Check out this GI Bill comparison tool that Marc (the Veteran I mentioned) built: https://www.vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/ . Seeing vets help out brothers and sisters who have served is really inspiring.

      Command E | Lead Engineer (#1) | San Francisco, CA | Onsite/Remote | Full Time
We're building a next-generation search tool, and we're hiring employee #1—a lead engineer who wants to get in at the ground floor (pre-seed/seed stage). Both co-founders are engineers who worked at First Round Capital, Eventbrite, and Digg. We worked together at a top VC firm for 3 years and have a healthy mix of engineering skills + business sense. We’re looking for a unique engineer who is persistent, exploratory, multi-disciplinary, and demonstrates leadership.

Command E helps provides effortless, lightning-fast navigation of your chaotic workspace. Command E lets you instantly search your cloud data (i.e. Google Drive, Salesforce, Trello/Asana, Dropbox/Box, wikis, and more). We’re bringing the “fuzzy finder” file-switching experience of vi/Emacs/IDEs to business people. Our unique technology searches across many cloud providers and displays results as you type, in less than 10ms.

Our stack is Electron/React/Redux/SQLite. We’re using ES6, async/await, Promises, and all the cool new JavaScript stuff, but the search index is backed by rock-solid native SQLite/C++. From a technical perspective there's tons of fun space to explore—high-performance full-text search indexing, fast async UIs, modern dev frameworks, encryption, or deploying cross-platform desktop apps.

We're at 3rd & Market in San Francisco and have legendary VC/angel investors. We met each other 4 years ago through a "Who's Hiring?” thread, so we're excited to see who responds to this one!

How do we make our system more resilient? We find vulnerabilities and risks in our system before they lead to customer-facing outages. To find vulnerabilities, we build Chaos tools that allow us to inject events that we expect the system to handle, and check that the service stays healthy. We are currently leveraging these tools to build a platform for load testing services with production traffic. This platform allows us to better understand the limits of our production systems. Finally, we track patterns of risks and vulnerabilities, which inform us of our biggest availability challenges and help us come up with risk mitigation strategies.

      Nava | Infrastructure Engineers, Fullstack Software Engineers, Designers | Washington DC, San Francisco SF, New York NYC, REMOTE | On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k+ + equity + benefits | We're a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.
It turns out there’s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why we’re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteran’s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.
It’s surprising how much can be done by a small group of diverse, empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. We’ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable. If you feel the same way, we'd love to hear from you.

      Zen Educate | Full stack engineer (React and Ruby) | London | Ideally onsite, but will consider remote | Full-time
UK schools spend over £2bn per year covering short-term absences with supply teachers. The current model is exclusively reliant on agencies that charge a massive commission and are terribly inefficient — everything is paper and phone-call based. We’re using technology to change this by building a marketplace to connect schools directly with teachers, pulling hundreds of millions of waste out of the education system.

We are well-funded by high-profile investors, have had significant early traction, and are led by start-up veterans behind two of London’s most prominent tech companies. As an early employee, you’ll play a significant role in the development of the company and have the opportunity for rapid career progression and learning.

We’re looking for a full stack engineer happy to work with React, Ruby and React native and who likes coming in each day working with a small, committed team on a mission for good.

We can sponsor visas if you’re interested in taking a move to London.

      Stasis Labs | Software Engineer - Web, Software Engineer - Mobile | Bangalore, India | ONSITE | https://www.stasislabs.com/

Our monitors are currently live in hospitals in India, and are built for global distribution. We have teams in Los Angeles, Bangalore, and working remotely.

      Beckman Coulter Life Sciences | JavaScript or C# Engineers | SW Oregon | Full-time | Onsite
BC makes actual hardware products.  This group makes boxes that sniff air and tell you how clean it is.  Useful for microchip makers and especially drug companies.

We’re not a startup, which means you don’t have to deal with 20-something hotshots who have something to prove, all the while writing code for products that nobody will ever want.  We don’t work 12-hour days while pretending to have unlimited personal time.  It’s a mature company that treats its employees with respect and pays them well.  And it makes actual stuff that gets built and shipped out the door.

It also wants to stay relevant with the latest technologies and needs your skills to keep up with the workload.  We have 14 openings right now.  The average employee here is probably over 35, and over a decade of service.

Salary range?  I’m getting paid more here than I ever did in California, and my annual take-home starts with a 2.  You don’t have to take a pay cut to move here.  And holy @#$% does it go far.

Imagine, living in a small city with a surprising array of big-city amenities, beautiful mountains everywhere, where almost everyone’s nice, most men wear beards, and you can afford a house with a yard on a single income.  Maybe like the town you grew up in.  We’re 4 hours from Portland, so don’t worry about getting too much of that scene unless you want to.

After grinding it out in the SF bay area dystopia for years, I felt like I’d died and gone to heaven when I took this job.  If you do well on your resume and phone screen, BC will fly you out for a daylong onsite, which is really useful if you’re on your last dime after getting sucked dry by California rents.  How about leaving that scene behind?

Must have college degree with high GPA in math, physics, computer science or related fields.   We typically desire many years of experience, but will consider recent graduates if the match is very strong.
                      
                  
      I have to say, I never imagined I'd see the day RenTec came into an HN Who's Hiring thread.Is this role in your NYC or Long Island facility? It doesn't seem to be reflected on your careers page.
                      
                  
      I wasn't planning on making the submission, but it just happened that the "Who's Hiring" thread was on the top of the page.    The truth is that it is difficult to find top talent for any organization.    The economy is booming, and we're competing with more firms.   As we all know: "Software is Eating the World".
This role could be in either location, but I expect it will be filled in our NYC offices.
We're no different than any other technology based firm.
                      
                  
      For what it's worth, I emailed careers@rentec.com about this position and I was told they're only hiring for positions on their website. Do you mind clarifying that a bit? Does this role map to one of the positions on the careers page?Any resume sent to careers@rentec.com will be entered into our system and be seen by one of the tech managers (which includes me).   If you don't mind my asking, when did you contact the firm?   I will speak with the people who process the received resumes to not discourage people from making submissions.The open position here most closely matches to the "Financial Infrastructure Programming" position.

We’re looking for a senior developer with experience in extracting unstructured data out of PDFs, preferably with Perl.

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in alot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”

      Permutive (YC S14) | Software Engineers | London, UK | Full-time, permanent, on-site, eligible to work in UKPermutive is the simplest, most efficient way to integrate data-driven models into your product.
We're a B2B SaaS company built on top of an innovative real-time data platform. We have product–market fit and customers that love us, and we're growing rapidly in Europe and the US. We raised a $10M Series A at the beginning of the year and have received funding from some of the world's best investors, including Y Combinator.
Everything we build operates at scale: our platform processes billions of requests a day across hundreds of millions of monthly end-users. We're developing a next generation data platform for a world with a trillion devices, and we think applying functional programming techniques like compositionality and type-safety is the best way to build these massive distributed systems.

You would be joining our core backend team on-site in London, working mostly with Scala and 'big data' ecosystem technologies (our full stack is below). We're happy to talk to people with a wide range of experience—from straight out of university to those with decades of experience—but you should have a genuine interest and preferably experience in FP, distributed systems, and stream processing.

Languages: Scala, Haskell, Elm

Libraries: Cats, Cats Effect, FS2, http4s, Shapeless, Circe, PureConfig, pipes, Servant

Technologies: Kafka, Kubernetes, Terraform, Bigtable, BigQuery, Beam, Postgres, Google Cloud Platform

      Blue Canvas | Sr. Engineer | San Francisco, Berlin or Remote | ~$100-120k + generous equity
Blue Canvas (https://bluecanvas.io/) is a source control product for the Salesforce developer ecosystem.

We've built a hosted service with automatic source control that "just works", and modern tools to review and deploy updates. We are in a growing, opportunity-rich enterprise market: For every $1 paid to Salesforce, $3 more are spent on customizing it.

Looking for a Python, Go or Node developer to join our 2 person team. An interest in source control systems and theory is a major plus.

So far we have hired slowly because we believe in maintaining high-revenue per employee. We admire companies like Basecamp, Mailchimp and Atlassian. We are funded by customer revenue and Indie.vc (http://www.indie.vc/).

Our stack is primarily Python and Go (Node.js developers interested in learning Go should also apply). You’ll get to work directly with the CTO on important technology decisions.
Email team@bluecanvas.io if you're interested. No recruiters please.

      35k in a city with a ~40% tax rate and rents approaching 2k/month.Developer salaries in Europe are a joke.
                      
                  
      There are a lot of really low-ball offers, but there is also a shortage of talented applicants, so you can find some stuff around for €140K or €85-110 / hour.You also don't need a car, work reasonable hours and get twice the vacation.
                      
                  
      Actually though. This is awful. I loved Amsterdam, but I can't imagine why anyone would stay in Europe when even new grads can make >= 4x that in the US.35k is low even for straight out of university. With a few years of experience it’s closer to 50-70k€ (57-80k$)That said, when I was doing the math on moving to the states, a +80% increase in salary still left me with less money in NYC vs Amsterdam. (I have kids: healthcare + kids education + rent basically wipes out your income in the US, it doesn’t in Amsterdam)
                      
                  
      Yup, and when your kids will go to uni you'll be paying 2.000 euro/year for TU Delft instead of 40.000 for MIT.Well one of the reasons (and it's a dumb one), is that getting a US work Visa is almost impossible for most, so they don't really have a choice, unfortunately.Problem is it's impossible to get a US work visa :)That is not a regular salary in the Netherlands, they are just being cheap. My first job paid 40k, in a cheaper city, 10 years ago without a university degree.
Tax brackets are progressive, with 35k you pay about 20% income tax. Expats get a 30% income tax discount for 5 years.

While salaries are low, it does have some advantages to live here. Strong  employee protection (you can't get fired for example), paid leave (minimum is 20 days + public holidays), you don't work more than 40h/week, cheap healthcare, good infrastructure and public transport, paid sick/disability, unemployment benefit, welfare, state pension, etc.
It is hard to compare employment salaries. I think it makes more sense to compare freelance wages as they don't have those benefits. Freelance engineers make about 80~100 euro/hour and get some tax discount.
                      
                  
      I paid 32% on 36k (my first job as a junior dev). But I had no ruling because I studied there for 6 months.Agree with everything else. Netherlands is a great country.
                      
                  
      I think you are mixing up the tax bracket with the total income tax you payed. With 36k you should pay approximately 25%. See https://www.berekenhet.nl/inkomen/belasting-box1-verschil.ht...Onelogin | Software Engineer | https://www.onelogin.com/ | Redmond (Seattle Area)

      Karuna Health | San Francisco, CA USA | Full-time | Onsite
Without guidance, patients often feel anonymous, isolated, and helpless.

Around the country, teams of health guides, often called “care managers,” work directly with patients to guide them through the healthcare system. The impact these teams have is inspiring, but is expensive and difficult to scale.

At Karuna, we build software that automates common care care coordination tasks so that care management teams can get back to what they do best: being there for patients when they need help the most. We're led by repeat founders, advised by three of the most prominent healthcare leaders in the U.S., and backed by some of the best seed funds on earth (First Round, BoxGroup, etc.). Since day one, helping patients has been part of our DNA. One of our patients told us: "I wish you were available to me when I first started this journey, and I believe that this could be a game changer for battling [my] disease."

We're hiring for Full Stack and Back-end Engineer roles. Some details for both roles:

- Responsibility for bringing Karuna's vision to life. Your input is crucial to everything we build.

- Write code with a deeply technical eng team (co-founder / CTO and two product-focused full-stack engineers).

- Rapidly prototype new features, measure impact, and collaborate with experienced product lead to update our roadmap.

- Take us from demo to production level code as soon as we're experiencing traction.

Hello fellow engineers and future teammates,

We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services. Being able to fuse realistic human-like conversation design ("character") and NLP/ML with the ubiquity of SMS/MMS (and RCS/Business Chat soon) is why I personally get out of bed in the morning as an engineer at OM.

It's also nice that goal-oriented conversations are like little conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our prioritization and decision making so there is a lot of interesting and impactful stuff to do there.

If you're into massive scaling and operations, we are currently humming along at hundreds of messages per second and have a roadmap to get to millions in the next few months. We need your help to get there.

For the design-inclined, one of our major features is the conversational composer frontend with previews/canvas drawing etc. that will evolve according to what the messaging channels can support in terms of content types and interaction. Messages are personalized in different ways.

We are hooking commerce functionality into the conversations as well. Buying products this way is a lot of fun as a user. Thanks to our design, we can kick off any kind of API calls as a natural part of the conversation without adding complexity to the codebase.

Our current tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker. We are exploring Go for some things and prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles. Creativity is best applied to data structures and decoupling.

We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy as well. No jerks or brogrammers, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!

There is a small code challenge that checks for data manipulation techniques. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding. Existing open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.
Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!

Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071

About BBOXX

Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.

BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable solar energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 solar systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.

      A fast-growing YC company! (S17) | Software Engineer (Full-Stack Web / Front-End / Back-End ) | Full-Time | ONSITE | SF Bay Area
Hi! I'm one of the engineers on the team :)

If you're interested in:

- Being an active participant in the decision-making process of a YC company rapidly capitalizing on an under-the-radar market opportunity

- Applying your technical skills to a meaningful domain outside of tech (while learning about industry insider nuances), that has real-world medical implications

- Being part of a small engineering team that not only measures daily active users but also physical products shipped, revenues, and real profits

- Being part of a small engineering team that ships not only software products but also physical products

- Watching how changes in your code physically impacts the operation of not just machines but the IRL work-flow of real people (specifically, pharmacists and technicians)

- Hands-on shipping of product, end-to-end! Everything from ideation --> coding --> customer delight (& wash-rinse-repeat)

then I'd love to hear from you!

Our stack: React, Node, GraphQL (+ Apollo), ES6, Raspberry Pi, AWS (RDS, ECS, CloudFront, EC2), Elasticsearch, Jenkins, Rails, Python, Linux (Ubuntu), Docker, and moar. Right tool for the job > dogma.

We have deliberately avoided press coverage around our traction, investors, and market because we have been focused on taking over the market as quickly as possible, but we will going public with what we're up to shortly in a few weeks! (I'm sorry there's no web site or company name to google for just yet--but I promise this isn't at all anywhere close to the pejorative "stealth" mode at work)

We're in the pharmacy (not pharmaceutical) space and I'm happy to elaborate more in private for serious inquiries.

We offer competitive Bay Area salary, stock equity, healthcare insurance, and other employee benefits.

      Spring Discovery | Data Scientist / Applied ML | Full-Time | Bay Area
Spring Discovery is applying machine learning to accelerate the discovery of therapies for aging and its many related diseases. Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases — by understanding and treating the biological damage accumulated as we age, we can find powerful new therapies for fighting disease and living healthier, longer lives.

Over the past few decades, an unignorable amount of evidence has piled up from the best labs in the world that this is possible [1]. But translating the science to real therapies has been challenging in a field that has historically struggled to experiment quickly. Here’s more on our mission and approach: https://medium.com/spring-discovery/accelerating-the-discove...

We have deep support from top-notch investors, including General Catalyst, First Round, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Felicis, Sam Altman, and more. And our advisory board includes both world leaders in aging research and senior pharma execs.

We have the beginnings of a great data pipeline (already several TB of rich biological data collected specifically for ML purposes) and are building out our own lab to accelerate data acquisition even more. We’re looking now to add to our early team with experienced data scientists or applied ML engineers who would enjoy working on things ranging from data infrastructure to modelling to statistical analysis of large datasets. Yes, you belong even if you don't have a bio background — we're a cross-functional team. (Although of course biology experience is a plus).

  - https://careers.ibm.com/ShowJob/Id/416940/?lang=en (data scientist)Hi blparker,
I'll be graduating this May 2019 from the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities with dual BS degrees in Computer Science and Statistical Science. For the past 6 months I've been interning at a commerce analytics company where I built a RESTful web service in Python 3.7, and prior to that I worked at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute where I gained experience with various big data frameworks.

The software engineering position sounds like it'd be a great fit for me given my statistics background. I also have experience applying/designing machine learning models and completed the graduate level ML classes at the U of M.

Asking candidly, would it be worth it for me to apply? Or is this position not open to new graduates? I am very interested and I'd love to discuss this opening with you more by phone or email, if possible.

Best,
~Mark

      BitMEX | San Francisco | On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.

Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!

Retail traders lose money in options trading. Investors blow up their accounts because: i)they don’t bet-size, ii) they buy options with all their money chasing 10x return iii) they do not limit losses and iv) they do not cover risks or hit stops iv) they buy options more often than selling them, which in the long run is a bad idea iv) they do not know how option value changes with time and spot and vol v) even when they have the right directional view about an underlying, they do not pick the best option strategy for a view.

Sensibull aims to change this, and turn them into successful investors.

      Ozora Research | Engineers, Linguists | Berkeley, CA | Part-Time | Onsite | Equity
My company, Ozora Research, is developing a next-generation suite of Natural Language Processing tools centered around sentence parsing. We spend our time thinking deeply about the structure of language and then building statistical models that capture the structure. The requirements are: a good background in mathematics and statistics, and a deep interest in language and linguistics. Programming skill is a huge plus, but not an absolute requirement.

I believe we are poised to make a huge dent in the world of NLP and linguistics. The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank). In my research I've discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. I've spent the last couple of years validating the approach, and now that I'm confident it works, I'm looking to build up a team.

I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won't appeal to everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also. I can also guarantee that you will get a ton of great experience that you would be tough to get at a big company. I want to especially encourage the following types of people to reach out:

- Recent grads in technical fields who want to break into the software engineering industry

- People who have had some success in mainstream software engineering careers, but are now bored and want to try something new

- People who want are thinking about going to graduate school in CS/ML/AI/NLP and want some experience doing research in that area
I'm happy to talk more about the specifics in person. Email me at daniel dot burfoot at gmail.

Institut Mines-Télécom (IMT -  https://www.imt.fr/en/) is a public institution dedicated to higher education, research (~1500 researchers) and innovation in engineering and digital technologies. 
We look for a senior DevOps engineer (5+ years experience) to join our team who develops and operates the TeraLab platfom https://www.teralab-datascience.fr/ . For about 5 years, TeraLab has hosted more than 60 innovation, research and education projects in the data domain (big data, AI, blockchain …). Most often with open source technologies, we address  cloud, distributed and secured architectures, cloud provisioning and configuration automation, datascience environment setup (linux, shorewall, nginx, openVpn QEMU/KVM,Docker, Kubernetes, Hadoop/spark, Cassandra, Mongodb, influxdb, ElasticSearch, Pyton/scikitlearn, R, tensor flow, Grafana, Ansible, Zabbix, gitlab….).
We restitute experience from/to our projects contacts (from large companies, SME, startups, researchers, students) and providers/partners
Given our small team size (currently 4 persons excluding physical infrastructure), you as the engineers in place are expected to address all the platform components and activities.
Profile: 
- Senior devops engineer
- has experienced most of  the above technologies and is skilled in network and security domains
- autonomous, responsible, thoroughTempo Automation | Full-Stack Software Engineer | SF | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://www.tempoautomation.com
Tempo operates a factory in SF to produce printed circuit boards extremely quickly - in doing so, we give our customers the physical equivalent of a fast compiler, enabling them to turn their designs into real products significantly faster than they could before. Our customers build rockets, drones, medical devices, and much more - working at Tempo means you can accelerate all of these industries at once. Providing a system to produce circuit boards quickly and correctly means we're both a software shop and an advanced manufacturer. Our software team is still pretty small (9 engineers) which means any new hires will still have an outsize impact on the direction of our technology, and on the company as a whole. We love hiring strong generalists [python experience highly preferred] who take initiative and act as part-time PMs when they're working on projects. Some projects you might work on:


  - Offering real-time, automated manufacturing feedback based on certain parameters of our customers' designs. Think linting for hardware.

  - Optimizing our factory processes with machine learning and scheduling algorithms.

  - Encoding the three-dimensional structure of each order's components (e.g. resistors, capacitors) for our assembly robots, in order to speed up assembly and ensure minimal manufacturing defects.

  - Optimizing our automated optical inspection machine to make it faster than any in the industry.

Tech Stack: Python | Django | React | Redux | PostgreSQL | AWS
We're also excited to have just moved into a MUCH larger factory and headquarters (>4x the floor space) in SoMa.If you're interested, please apply at https://www.tempoautomation.com/careers or send a note to austin [at] tempoautomation [dot] com.

Root is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.

We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.

We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 20 states.

We’ve raised around $178M in VC and have around 215 employees. We’re looking for more talented engineers to join us.

  * NOT ACTUALLY AN ENGINEER – loads of our functionality is build using the Stacker platform, 
    so if you love products but can't write code, do we have the job for you!

.
We're fully remote (founders in London, Geneva and Johannesburg), and flexible about working arrangements.

Here's the deal: This is NOT your "come-to-work-to-run-some-scripts" kind of job.

So far, this responsibility has been directly on the product development engineers.

Box has an incredible culture that empowers, allows space for creativity and encourages taking initiative and ownership.

The person we will hire needs to be a strong software engineer with passion for testing and automation. If you think that test frameworks development is second-class coding, I recommend you take a look at the design of libraries like go-vcr. Pure genius.

      Podaris | Javascript developer | London, UK, | Remote | https://www.podaris.com/
Podaris is re-inventing how the world plans cities. We're developing a platform for urban infrastructure planning that combines elements of BIM and GIS, with a focus on agile, real-time collaboration.

We’re looking for a full-stack software engineer to join our growing team. You'll be able to make a big impact, joining a small but very enthusiastic team. For this role, you'll primarily focus on mathematical problems: computational geometry, parametric constraint solvers, network routing optimisation, etc -- problems that come up in the course of modeling both physical transport infrastructure and transport network simulation and analysis. However you should be enough of a generalist to be unafraid to dive into other areas of the application where needed.

Technology-wise, Podaris is built on Javascript/ES6, Meteor.js, OpenStreetMap, and OpenLayers. Your expertise with Javascript is more important to us than your experience with the particular libraries that we use. Experience with building large single-page apps is particularly helpful. Experience with Java-based OSM routers (and other associated or similar tooling) is also a strong plus.

We're based in London, UK, but are open to remote workers from anywhere in the world, provided we can establish a collaborative rapport. Currently we can only offer a six-month contract, but will aim to convert that into a salaried role pending additional funding. Equity is also available for extraordinarily talented individuals.

We're building program synthesizers, i.e., automation that can write code.

I have an MVP in production that reads/writes smart contracts (i.e., small, permanent, apps) in Ethereum's Solidity language, and use it to ensure our customer's code is secure and correct. Synthesis could eventually enable access to code for non-programmers. For now, goal is simple: My customers give me source code for their contract (= Ethereum apps, which are self-contained). I use synthesis to generate another contract/app that demonstrates any problematic interaction.

Namebase is a top-level domain registrar and exchange for the Handshake blockchain. Namebase makes it easy for anyone to buy/sell Handshake coins (HNS) and use their HNS to register TLDs.-- Why should you care?
The internet wasn't built to handle the scale it supports today. The DNS we rely on is supported by ducktape solutions that fail to serve the security and reliability needs of today's internet. For instance, compromised Certificate Authorities threaten SSL (https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/certificate-authority-vulner...), and domains get seized for arbitrary reasons, even for good actors (https://twitter.com/zoho/status/1044249648993525760?s=20).
Handshake fixes these issues by letting anyone register secure, censorship-resistant TLDs on the blockchain. More details can be found in the whitepaper https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt.

Namebase is driving adoption of Handshake's DNS by making it easier to use and more powerful.

We are looking for an experienced frontend engineer to join our team of 4 including 2 engineers.

      WaiveCar | Programmer, Engineer, Designer | Santa Monica + Hollywood, California | Onsite | full-time
WaiveCar was one of the first companies in the current urban mobility revolution. I'm the CTO and also the person that's referenced at the top of these monthly post for the past few years. We've had a few companies that have unicorned out of Santa Monica, essentially based on our idea. FireflyOn, the people who put screens on top of ubers, had us in their slidedeck. We've got a number of attack vectors and partnerships in our response and need more resources to execute them.

Our users love us and we have a cult following. Now it's time to grow the cult. I'm authoring our revolution round 2 and this time we're not going to let it slip away by Bird and Lime like the last one.

I'm trying to (as of about a week ago) now aggressively build a large team so we scale or fail. We're changing our strategy and you can be a part of it. Here's a partial list of people we need:

* Solid mobile app developers

* Backend or full-stack

* Designers

* Hardware specialists with EE experience

* Mechanical Engineers to help build the next-gen of our screens

We're in a large system-wide overhaul and removing all the anti-scaling valves we have in place. I need people who want to aggressively move products forward and think big.

We offer competitive salaries and all that, sure. But if you just want a job, go elsewhere. You need to have a unwavering passion to build infrastructure. I'm here to kick ass and you should be too. We're dedicated to innovation in the marketplace, think dot.coms circa 1994 ... the dreams and passion to change things.

How to apply: Email me chris(at)waive.car. Text or call me 657 210 1337. Don't be shy.

      King & Union | Python developer | Washington, DC | ONSITE + HOME FULL-TIME
The point: We are an information security/threat intelligence company. Our goal is to make the threat intelligence process run more smoothly and help organizations share threat data better. Our solution pulls threat information (both our own and via external APIs) into a graph (visual and graph db) and enables real-time collaboration and sharing of the information on the graph. (If you're aware of the tools, think of combining Google docs with a graph editor like Maltego and mix in some process automation.)

What we're looking for: We're looking for a mid/advanced back-end developer for the back-end of our web-based application. Security experience isn't needed, we've got that covered already. Our backend is built with Django/Django Channels/Redis. Our UI connects to the backend with a mix of REST and WebSockets (we're using websockets for real-time collaboration work). Ideally, the person we're looking for would be comfortable doing both the Python and Django side of things as well as some command line work (we have a data repository that we also maintain). We will also be working on designing and implementing a (possibly quite large) graph DB in the near future.

Perks of the job: early round shares, competitive salary, 401k, & healthcare benefits. Also, we work from home a lot and our focus is on getting the work done, not on attendance or face time.

A bit about us: We are a pre-A-round startup. We have a working product and paying customers, so we're in a good spot financially. We are based in Alexandria, VA but do a lot of working from home, and tend to meet up in Alexandria once a week or so. We have staff doing some of these roles already but we're looking to accelerate our pace.
We encourage all who are interested to contact us. You can reach me at: aaron@kingandunion.com

We’re hiring! United Income is a fintech startup looking to add engineering talent to our team. Email us at engineering@unitedincome.com if this describes you.

• Do you care about delivering quality product to your users?

• Is providing maintainable, tested code to your fellow engineers (and future self) important to you?

• Do you have a deep understanding of Javascript and/or Python? Are you interested in the movement to a serverless infrastructure?

• When you encounter a problem that isn't neatly packaged and fully defined, are you passionate about digging into it and refining a solution?

If you can answer yes to these questions, you'll find working here exciting and engaging.

At United Income, we value collaboration. We encourage one another to build phenomenal things, and individually we’re all passionate about doing our best work.

As you tackle these problems head on, you'll work with others across the company to make sure you have all the information you need.

Some of our engineering roles involve cool mathematical modeling.

We are committed to equal opportunity and diverse hiring. Even more important than hiring is supporting our diverse team, and we are dedicated to equitable pay and transparency.
As you know, this industry moves FAST. If you have 15 years of Node.js experience...well we think you’re lying ;) We don't expect you to be familiar with our entire tech stack (buzzwords: Javascript/Python/React/AWS/CI/CD/Git). What’s important is your willingness and ability to learn. We want to see your curiosity and passion for what’s out there.

1) Senior Machine Learning Engineer | £80k+ (https://longshot-systems-ltd.workable.com/j/529141E6D2).

      SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE
The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 6 months ago I moved to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We’ve hired 3 remote developers so far and it’s been a great experience!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours.
Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

      Senior Growth Data Analyst (Remote) at Drops
If you have a soft spot for bootstrapped, profitable companies with a meaningful product, and you want to use your data analyst / growth skills for good, you’ll like this.

About us:

Drops’ goal is to turn language learning into a delightful game while ensuring effective learning. Our app is in the Appstore for 3 years, teaches 31 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - Editors' Choice on the Play Store - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe. We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Git and Trello and have a release twice a week. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 7 million, a monthly active of >800,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.

You can find us here: http://drops.app.link/

About you:

You’ll be responsible for improving the quantity, quality and reliability of the multivariant tests we run.

You’re a no-nonsense person, who is comfortable taking ownership of all aspects of our analytics & growth funnel, who has experience in working at a product company, and who can bring us insights, initiatives and execution that will help us grow.

We want everyone to see the big picture: this means you already pushed your boundaries outside of the strict data realm, and are knowledgeable about mobile and web growth frameworks, ASO, SEO, best practices regarding retention and monetization.

We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product & driven to grow professionally, than in managing people.

We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.

* The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy
* Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools
* Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc.
* Experience deploying at least one application that other people use
* Have held at least one engineering position post-education
* Initiative, curiosity, a bias for action, and a problem-solving attitude

(not a full-time job, just me doing a solid for our UX designer by throwing it in ;-D there is compensation though, and it only takes about an hour of your time. We'll mail you a PDF of our findings as well. )
Storj develops an open-source, decentralized cloud storage platform called Storj (pronounced storage) that is disrupting the cloud storage market. Rather than storing files in a data center, Storj works by encrypting and partitioning files, then sending the shards to a network of devices contributed by our global community—with active storage nodes on every continent except Antarctica. We rent unused hard drive space from users all over the globe, operating active storage nodes on every continent (except Antarctica). Our core target is selling to software developers and channel partners who get higher quality, privacy, and security at 1/6th the price. We are laying the groundwork for the future of decentralization and web 3.0.

Headquartered in Atlanta, Storj is a global company with North American employees in California, Washington, Utah, Michigan, and Georgia, and European employees in Germany and Bulgaria.

Most of our engineering team sits in Atlanta, where the company was founded. We're in the Atlanta Tech Village, Buckhead. The bulk of our marketing team is in our downtown Salt Lake City office at the Impact Hub co-office building located at 150 S. State Street.

Many of them have managed or co-managed: design, assembly supervision, post-assembly tests, start-up of devices and electrical power engineering systems, practically in all newly erected or modernized power plants, combined heat and power plants, substations and industrial plants in Poland and abroad.

The Energotest R&D department team is looking for a senior developer who would be willing to take part in setting new directions in the development of systems for the broader "Industry 4.0". The person will help us change the world of automation systems, face the task of creating tools for engineers and firmware for devices manufactured by Energotest. Working together in the R&D department, we are happy to share our knowledge, but the ability to independently solve problems and look for information will be a desirable skill. If you have skills that do not meet all of the following requirements, but enter other areas of programming and feel that they will help develop our project or make it a unique product, we will gladly talk to you. Currently we are building a device (based on embedded Linux) and some tools to configure it (with C++/Qt).

Essential skills: GNU/Linux, Git, Bash, C++, Boost, Qt

Nice to have (in random order):

* Python (and Boost.Python)

* Experience with embedded Linux (yocto)

* Modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17)

* Functional programming (Haskell, Erlang)

* Web technologies (Elm, PureScript)

Extra notes:

* It doesn't harm if you also know MFC, C#, Delphi and Windows in general

* Official language in Energotest is Polish

* Remote work is partly possible (1 day/week)

      Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers...). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Square Cash, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of remote, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but work from anywhere they want.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:
- You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.
- You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.
- You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.
- You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.
- You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
- You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

      Facet Development | Remote | Ex-FAANG engineers (Full Stack, Front End, and everything else)
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post here or not - we aren't a recruiting firm or job board. We are a home for freelancers/contractors and we have several openings.

Facet Development is a freelancer network made up exclusively of ex-FAANG engineers. Facet does the work of finding freelancing jobs/projects and then we send them out to the devs in the network. We also provide project management and billing/collections, help with taxes, etc, so freelancers get to spend a lot more of their time doing the enjoyable parts of freelancing and not trying to run a small business.

We target FAANG companies and companies that wish they could hire FAANG devs when finding work for our freelancer network. When I was a dev lead at Microsoft, bringing on vendors or outsourcing was a terrible experience, because they always seemed to be below our hiring bar. So I started Facet to solve the problem I had when I was an engineering manager at a FAANG company.

If you are a FAANG or ex-FAANG dev that wants to switch to freelancing or already is, you should join: https://www.facetdev.com/developer-network

Want to watch the software you build immediately get put to use at the highest levels of the music industry?

Want to join a team of hard working, fun loving people who are still a little weird and know how to both ship rock solid code and not take life too seriously?

We at Lyte.com are searching for skilled senior level API/Server engineers who can help us continue to build out our platform.

Lyte has particularly strong deals across the music industry, these deals have allowed us to build fan to fan exchanges for sold out events. For example, you want to purchase a ticket to an event that is sold out, maybe you don't want to get scammed or pay inflated prices on known secondary markets (craigstlist, SH, etc.), you visit a Lyte exchange and request a ticket, as people who don't want to go to the show return tickets, you will be offered the ability to buy their ticket without having to get involved with them or pay crazy prices.  We have direct integrations that allow us to re-register/transfer/remix tickets between primary issuing agencies so that fans have a cost-friendly, scam free ticketing experience.

To date, we have done numerous exchanges and have significant business traction from many top players in the music industry.  We are gearing up for a very big 2019.

If this sounds interesting to you and you have very, very solid chops with Python/Django please send an email to john@lyte.com with supporting information.  We have a seasoned engineer who handles all recruiting so you will deal directly with the team and if things click, you could join our team in under a week.  We pay well and have a reasonable amount of perks for a pre-A startup that is punching way above its weight.

Full Stack Engineer | Front-end Engineer

One of the biggest pain points when working with Big Data is that the data is stored across multiple sources and data warehousing is expensive and doesn't allow you to work on the data easily.

We heavily contribute to and use several open source projects like Apache Arrow to achieve this and are hiring engineers.  We are looking for both front-end engineers and full-stack engineers (we use Java on the backend) to help grow our product.

Knotel | multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://knotel.com
Knotel is a fast growing commercial real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.

Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.

As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are building internal tools to increase our efficiency as a company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.

In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to solve.

We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.

Today we're hiring a whole bunch of roles:
- Lead Full Stack Engineer https://grnh.se/91ad31da1
- Data Engineer https://grnh.se/d5c41fd31
- Senior DevOps Engineer https://grnh.se/e43371b81

      Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard | Cambridge/Boston, MA | Software Engineer | INTERNS, ONSITE, VISA
We're a small team of software engineers, computational biologists, clinicians, and geneticists building cutting-edge tools and methods for interpreting some of the largest genomic datasets in the world (~500,000,000 genetic variants in ~200,000 human genomes/exomes). We aim to determine how genetic variation alters our proteins, biochemical pathways, cells, tissues, physiology, and traits/susceptibility to disease.

This position involves developing a React component library for visualizing genomic data. We are looking for friendly people with demonstrated experience in web tech, an eye for design, and genuine excitement to learn new things. Experience building performant React web applications preferred. In your email, please link to an online portfolio/github repo, and bonus points if you've built a nontrivial data visualization app. Technologies we use: React, Redux, D3, SVG, Python, GraphQL, nodejs, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform.

In this role, you'll receive domain-specific training at a world-class research institute. We're supportive of candidates interested in transitioning to graduate school. Your work will be 100% open source and highly visible in the genetics/genomics community. Our tools are used by tens of thousands of researchers and physicians around the world who cure disease and make biological discoveries. Come help shape the future of human genetic data visualization and discovery!

      Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/ Position: Full-Stack Engineer, Application Engineer, DevOps, Data Scientist Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, GraphQL, Docker, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS Team: we're a diverse 6 person company (across Data, Engineering, Chemistry, and Biz). Everyone gets trained as a professional taster.
Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products and optimize their existing brands by predicting the optimal flavor, aroma and texture for target consumer cohorts.

Our Services

_Innovation Management_: New product development, flavor profile optimization, & portfolio management (multi-product optimization).

_Cognitive Marketing_: Product description optimization to prime consumers to like a product more by purposely engineering a perception bias.

_Deep Market Insights_: Predictions for emergent market preferences by region and demographic.

The Position(s)

_Engineering_: We're currently looking in two specific areas: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Streaming infrastructure focused engineers capable of integrating the data pipeline and outputs of machine learning models into an easy to use management platform.

_Data Science_: Data science is central to the value and insights we provide for our clients. We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. We are a team of data scientists that understand our clients and turn nebulous business goal into quantitative decision metrics and predictive models to optimize those metrics. The extensive role of data scientists at Analytical Flavor Systems allows us to invest in their education across sensory perception (standard sensory science so they know what we're improving and replacing), tasting experiences (so they appreciate the products we work on and understand how the data is collected), production knowledge, and data science tear-downs (a meeting where the team collaboratively attempts to find and fix problems, try new techniques, and debate the philosophical implications of a model's construction).

Next Steps
Please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.

      Zipcar | https://www.zipcar.com | San Mateo, CA | ONSITE Full-time (VISA) | Firmware/Embedded C/C++ and Rust
Zipcar is the world’s largest shared-mobility company. We are expanding our engineering team at our SFBA office in San Mateo, and we are looking for passionate, innovative people to help develop our next-generation telematics platform, and keep tens of thousands of in-the-field devices humming. Best of all, you can push the state of the art while you do it with Rust!

We are in the early stages of a green-field redesign of our in-car telematics platform, and are making a big play to write the firmware in Rust. We have support from upper management to open-source what we can (a sampling of the repos is here[1]), and are legitimately pushing the cutting edge of what's achievable. It's _incredibly_ exciting, and you can join us in building first-of-their-kind secure IoT devices. Beacuse it's a new and growing language, we're also realistic about letting our people grow into Rust expertise, and value flexibility over resume bullet points.

The rest of our stack is bare metal C on PIC and RTOS C++ on ARM, with Java on the server/data ingestion side, so you'll need to be at-least-conversant all the way up the stack. When we say "full stack", we mean it! :)

What will you be doing it for? Building connected-car technology for multiple product lines, including Zipcar and Avis. By putting our massive fleets behind an API, we are aiming to be the AWS of transportation.

Example of our connected car work for Avis: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-avis-budget-grp-tech-kans...

Mission-driven. Small team. Flexible working conditions. No worries about funding. :)

I have never been happier at a job; this place is great. I build solutions that breathless news articles (still!) talk about happening in the future. I help to move the state of the art in embedded Rust. I'd be one of your peers, and I'm happy to answer questions off-the-record (hn profile address) or on (bmatthews!zipcar,com)

      Magic | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | Full-stack | Engineering
Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company in San Francisco, CA that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters. We don't stop until we are done.

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.

Bonus points if you've got...
- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins
- Experience within early-stage startups or human operations companiesApply here: https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hn

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3]

Tanium has a strong engineering culture and takes really good care of it's employees. E.g. team gatherings (3~4/year) leave Monday and Friday open for travel rather than taking half your weekend.

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.

On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

Technology has made the world more connected, fundamentally changing how we live, work and interact; yet traditional schools have not evolved to prepare students for the 21st century. Replacing textbooks with tablets won’t be enough. We believe schools need a new foundation. That’s why we’re building a web-based school scheduling platform, that allows administrators to put master schedules and daily calendars into a single cloud-based system. We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools. We are also a company that deeply values diversity in every way.

Personal note: I've been on the Abl engineering team for a little over a year and I love it. The mission and the team make coming into work _awesome_. We have a diverse team, we're well funded, we have experienced leadership... I could go on. The interview process is, in my opinion, very fair. You won't be asked to white board and we understand that the process is just as much the candidate getting to know the company as it is the other way around.

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Data Scientist:

The Role

We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You’ll collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers, and school leaders to build software features that help schools overcome complex logistical challenges.

As a Data Scientist at Abl, your work will immediately improve equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype, with engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.

Recent data science projects include:
Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule
Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule
Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices
Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking
The Team

Our product research and development team is small, passionate, and inclusive. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.

As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.

Responsibilities

+ Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, and predictive models)

+ Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl’s product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production

+ Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling

+ Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools

+ Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources

+ Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate

+ Determine how to evaluate equity, or fairness, for students and for teachers

+ Propose metrics for evaluating the overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules’ ability to meet school leader priorities

+ Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school data

Qualifications

+ Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)

+ Proficiency in writing SQL queries

+ Ability and desire to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences (e.g., in writing, through reporting tools, and at in-person presentations)

+ Experience with cleaning, structuring, and transforming data via ETL processes

+ Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Front-End Engineer:

Your Impact

+ Work collaboratively with the Product and Design team to understand the experiences and pain points of schools, teachers, and students

+ Define and build compelling new products and exciting new features that give educators insights that will enable them to optimize how they use their resources

+ Use your extensive knowledge of front-end technologies to build high-quality designs that are scalable

+ Manage code review, increase performance, and communicate best front-end engineering practices

+ Create a first of its kind interface that will progress K-12 schools and their communities

Qualifications

+ Experience with Javascript frameworks such as React, Backbone, Angular etc.

+ You should have a great feel for user experience and an eye for beautiful designs

+ Bring a deep understanding of best practices in design, optimization, interaction, and usability

+ Familiarity with the whole web stack, including protocols and web server optimization techniques

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Backend Engineer

Qualifications

+ B.S. degree in computer science or equivalent work experience

+ Strong fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering

+ Familiarity with server-side frameworks like Ruby on Rails

+ Experience building large scale distributed systems and networked services

Your Impact

+ Help set the direction of our company and product

+ Measurably improve student outcomes

+ Improve the lives of teachers

+ Help spread new, innovative school models

+ Give schools greater visibility into how they use their time and resources, enabling them to better support their students and teachers

      DrivenData Labs | Software Engineer (Python) With Focus On Data Applications | Berkeley, CA | FULL-TIME, ONSITE | http://drivendata.co
-- OVERVIEW --

DrivenData brings the transformative power of data science to organizations tackling the world's biggest challenges. We run online machine learning challenges with social impact, and we work directly with mission-driven organizations to drive change through machine intelligence and analytics.

We are looking for a talented software engineer who is interested in using their job to take on tough social challenges, while growing their data acumen and building real-world applications. As a core member of a small team your role will include managing code development, brainstorming approaches to engineering problems, working closely with data science and machine learning developers, and taking an open and constructive mindset to getting things done across multiple projects. You'll work directly with data scientists that started their careers as software engineers, bringing an experienced understanding of software processes alongside opportunities to learn new quant skills, tools, and ways of approaching data applications.

-- ROLE --

This is a software developer role ideal for a Python engineer with 3-5 years of professional experience who is interested in data (possibly looking to transition into data engineering or data science). Advanced proficiency in Python and comfort with Linux a necessity. Good opportunity to learn the quant skills necessary to work in the data space. No need to have a background in math or a CS degree, but the job will involve a lot of quantitative thinking so the applicant should not be afraid of math.

Working on a small team means doing a little bit of a lot of things. We're looking for somebody who can ask the right questions to figure out what is important, iterate between brainstorming together and working independently, and exercise sound engineering judgment to make reasonable decisions under conditions of ambiguity.

Doing client-facing work involves turning uncertainty into a reasonable path forward. As a team, we value arguments for how to proceed based on evidence, and we want somebody who will present their opinion and engage in a discussion around the best way forward.

Here are some of the things you'd be doing on an ordinary day:

- Internal software development: Maintain our Django codebase for drivendata.org, fix bugs, add features, safely refactor and maintain test coverage. Develop new internal tooling and improve on existing apps.

- Client-facing software development. Build a variety of applications, generally small green-field proofs of concept. Quickly learn and adopt new technologies on demand based on client needs; a typical engagement may include at least one data technology we haven't all worked with before (e.g. Elasticsearch, Apache Storm, Cassandra).

- Light DevOps Tasks

-- REQUIREMENTS --

Critical skills: Python (advanced), Linux (advanced), SQL (intermediate to advanced). Must be able to learn quickly by reading appropriate documentation in order to write clean, idiomatic code.

Nice to have: Experience using IaaS like Amazon AWS or PaaS like Heroku. Experience using Docker. Exposure to big data tools like Spark or Hadoop, or familiarity with the underlying ideas like MapReduce.

      Parse.ly | Growth & Data Lead | Remote | Fully Distributed Team | https://parse.ly
Parse.ly is the web's attention engine. As a measurement layer running across the web, Parse.ly quantifies how visitors respond to online content. Our products are then used by the web's biggest brands and publishers to understand audience attention across the internet in real-time. Our flagship product is Parse.ly Analytics (https://parse.ly/analytics), and is already used by over 400 enterprise customers (https://parse.ly/customers).

But, Parse.ly is just getting started. We just launched Parse.ly Currents (https://parse.ly/currents), a new product that helps people understand internet-wide trends and how content/attention flows online.

As the Growth & Data Lead for Parse.ly, you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, and you want to take a B2B software company out of its successful niche and across the chasm into the broader market. You are comfortable with remote & fully distributed teams. To excel here, you'll work with designers and web developers as collaborators, and be able to leverage data-oriented growth marketing strategies, such as launching search engine optimized public products built atop Parse.ly's data, or important sharing features in our existing sites and products.

You are the kind of person who'd enjoy the books "Hacking Growth", "Traction", "Four Steps to the Epiphany", and "High Growth Handbook". For bonus points, you also care about SaaS enterprise sales. For example, you are the kind of person who enjoyed Dan Pink’s "To Sell is Human".

In this role, you'd run a small team of designers and developers that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s public website, technical documentation, knowledge base, emails/newsletters, data studies, and blog. You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to any of these projects, with a goal of growing sign-ups (and customers) for these products. From a technical standpoint, you'll be data savvy, know some SQL, and be comfortable working with designers/developers, who themselves are comfortable with a modern JavaScript and Python development stack. You'll also use analytics tools like Google Analytics, MixPanel and yes, even, Parse.ly itself, to understand engagement of our visitors, and to position us for more growth in new channels like organic search, social sharing, data-driven press, and free (self-service) data products.

If you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, this job is for you. If you are a former startup founder seeking to relocate to an established startup, but want to continue the path of deploying lean growth techniques, this role may be especially suited for you.

Apply here:

Email work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/projects you think may be relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile. Make sure to mention HN and the "Growth & Data Lead" role. Also, please list your timezone, working hours, and location. Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US/Eastern timezone, due to the timezone makeup of this team.
^ A note on our fully distributed team. The mission of our lean distributed team is described here: https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission. We happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices.

The Long(er) Read

We all know companies that have transformed industries (e.g., Google, Netflix, Spotify) by analysing information about you and giving you personalised suggestions that seem to know you better then even yourself – but where is the equivalent for jobs? Netflix’s recommendations are not based on “back of the box” blurbs - instead, they extract traits from movies and match them to your taste, based on your interactions. So why are we still evaluating people based on their “blurbs,” i.e. their CVs?

We use a combination of unique behavioural data, machine learning, and of course efficient product development, to go beyond the CV and find patterns that humans would otherwise not detect (at least not at scale).

Our longer-term goal is to be not only a preferred destination for transactional hiring, but a compelling, intuitive guide to planning and executing your career goals.

We have just closed a successful fundraising round and are expanding our team! This is a super exciting time to join, as it’s still early enough that you'll help us shape the foundations of the platform and tackle some very interesting problems, yet we’ve already got enough usage, traction and data that you'll have a real, immediate effect on people's lives.

We are very serious about finding the right mix of talent, passion and ownership that meets our values, and is necessary for an ambitious early-stage startup. As we grow, the expectation is that you will too. All doors are open, from diving deeper into a technical speciality, to moving sideways into another area, to mentorship and leadership roles - in the end, it's down to you, your goals and your performance.
If you want to be a part of a big, ambitious story, let's chat!
                      
                  
      > no cubicles
Just FYI there's research showing that open offices lead to more sickness, less interaction and higher turnover.

The world’s largest work-for-yourself platforms like Uber, Etsy, Airbnb, Instacart, Postmates, Rover, TaskRabbit, Care.com, and others use Stride to help recruit, retain and motivate their communities of independent workers.
We're located in the heart of San Francisco's South Park district and we’re backed by leading investment firms including Venrock, New Enterprise Associates, and F-Prime Capital Partners.

Come help us take the work out of working for yourself!

At Stride we work hard, sweat the details, and enjoy life away from computer, too. We are a diverse group that celebrates and supports our differences. Our benefits include a competitive salary and equity package, health, dental, and vision plans, a kitchen stocked with healthy (and unhealthy) snacks, a stipend for wellness programs, commuter benefits, flexible vacation time, parental leave, a culture of learning and development, a dog-friendly office environment, and more!

      Anyone hiring in Belgium? Been on the lookout for a software engineer gig, but anything that doesn't pay peanuts seems mostly shortish term government contracting :/I recently purchased Gaia GPS and was pretty disappointed with the app. I was in the middle of nowhere with lots of possible tracks, but when I tried to zoom out on my mobile the detail containing those tracks got lost. That made it near impossible to find out where I was, and I longed for a traditional paper map.We detached this subthread from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18356097 and marked it off-topic.It's right in the header for this thread: Commenters: please don't reply to job posts to complain about something. It's off topic here.I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience.I'd love to troubleshoot and figure out what went wrong. Would you mind going into Settings in the app, and doing "Send Logs" and pasting in your comment from here? I'll see that message in our support bin and follow up with you, and that will give us information about what data you have loaded, your system specs, etc.
                      
                  
      Done, thank you.I don't think I'm seeing it yet... it's possible the logs are stuck in your outbox... this sometimes happens on Android if the logs are too big. I only see one sending of logs that was sent without explanation in our box.
* If the logs are too big to send, it's probably enough to go on if I know the email associated with your account. You could email me at andrew@gaiagps.com and let me know.
* If that's not enough, we can get the logs a different way too or maybe I'll have some questions.
