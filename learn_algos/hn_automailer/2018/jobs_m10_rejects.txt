      Microsoft | Consultants, Architects, Software Engineers, and everything else| REMOTE, INTERNS, WORLDWIDE
Microsoft is recruiting across all technical roles. Our engineering roles are primarily located in the major tech hubs (Seattle/Redmond, Bay Area, Boston, London, etc...), but we also have a large remote "field" doing application development work in consulting, highly advanced technical support, and technical sales support.

We write code and provide advice that delivers the largest, most complex and strategic implementations of Microsoft technologies for external customers. As we are a distributed organization, at least 50% travel is expected. Recruiting is being conducted broadly across all technical stacks. If you are a great developer and eager to learn new technologies or platforms, we want to talk to you.

Example projects include: developing blockchain based inventory control systems, tracking biological pathogens, reinventing an organization's recruiting platform and process, developing massive IoT telemetry ingestion platforms, and building media delivery platforms for some of the biggest sporting events in the world.
You can reach out to me directly by going to https://aka.ms/AppsHnRecruit or you can apply to Microsoft at https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en
                      
                  

      Of all companies, I never expected Microsoft to be remote friendly. Nice.I worked there for a long time as a Senior Developer. I certainly wouldn't call it remote friendly unless you have a manager willing to fight for your ability to work remote.We are hiring for field (consulting, support, tech sales/architecture and some customer facing engineering) positions remotely, with varying degrees of travel. Core engineering teams are still largely on Prem, although I’ve been delivering software on the consulting side so long I’m a bit out of touch there.If this is the division I am part of, there are definitely remote friendly roles available.  The nature of the role will impact travel.  My current role balance is about 25% travel, 30-50% coding, the remainder mentoring, design, etc.Any Engineering positions REMOTE?Core engineering, not really, although Xamarin might be an exception. Customer facing engineering, consulting, support engineering, and other field based software dev roles are primarily distributed, with varying degrees of travel. Ive been doing application development in the consulting services wing for quite a while now, so I’m a bit out of touch with the product engineering groups.Hi Chris, thanks for posting. Just reached out to you via HN form. Cheers!United States Digital Service | Senior Software Engineers, Senior Site Reliability Engineers, Senior Designers, and more! | Washington, DC | ONSITE https://www.usds.gov/

      We've got a lot of impactful projects to work on. It turns out that government systems/technology need a lot of help, and USDS is well-positioned to assist.I applaud you for what you're doing. I also know you've heard this 100 times Matt, but maybe it'll be the 101st time that makes the decisions makers allow this. Allow remote.This country spans a large area & a lot of it is full of people who would love to help their country do better, but few want to move to DC. The US "Digital" Service should be a shining example to others of how to work remotely.
                      
                  
      I hear you. Right now a lot of our meetings involve sitting with or across from decision makers, and being in DC is really critical for that.For what it's worth, some of our individual agency engagements (e.g. VA or DoD) might allow you to come to DC for a short while like three months and then work remotely after that. But most of our work is in DC, at least for now.
                      
                  
      If that was something you promoted for the summer months when school is out & one could bring their family with, I think you would have a lot of takers.Best wishes!
                      
                  
      Just keep senior people there as code reviewers and 'account managers' who would sit down with stakeholders from DC. Then open source some of the other projects or at least add approved citizens that could work remotely on low-security projects. (Like some of the commenters above).I’ve said it to you before, and I’ll say it again, thank you for your service Matt. Listened to you on the TWiT network and have followed your career ever since.
I’m on vacation this week, and while my wife reads, I spelunk data in the US Census and American Community Survey. I’ve been looking this week at polling proximity for voters based on demographics and RUCA coding, to see how fair access is to voting throughout the country. I’ve had to primarily use third party data sources because the government datasets are poor or non existent (thanks to Census Reporter, Google Civic API, and Google Distance Matrix API).

I hope other engineers like yourself take the challenge and seek to improve our technology. We need it, and it’s important!
Thanks again Matt.
                      
                  
      It sounds like your current gig would keep you 100% busy, but if timing or life changes might allow for you to come do a tour, it sounds you've been bit by the same civic bug as us!Definitely. Maybe need to get Google to buy my startup and I’ll go spend a couple years in service :)
If I’m ever in DC I’ll reach out. Would love to take a tour and learn more.
Best of luck to you and the team, Matt. Email is in my profile if I can ever be of assistance.
                      
                  
      Is USDS doing any work with the IRS? I'm currently working at a tax policy think tank, and from what I can see I think the IRS could definitely use help on a number of fronts. Probably the biggest thing: they've got to finish rewriting their tax filing system to not be in assembly--don't know if they've made good progress on getting it into Java. Their SOI data could also use a better system for hosting/distribution along the lines of data.gov.We have done some work with the IRS in the past, such as https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2016/irs-secure-acce...We don't currently have an engagement at the IRS/Treasury, but if we get more people to sign up, that would increase the odds. :)
                      
                  
      Just FYI the IRS is hiring directly. I keep seeing them advertising open software engineering positions in Austin, TX, though I'm uncertain about other locations.Please don’t help the irs.Are you Libertarian or do you have a non-partisan objection to the IRS specifically?In my experience, "starving the beast" just means you're locked in a room with a starving beast. Bureaucracies can be awful to deal with. But if you strip them of resources, the laws that dictate their mission are unchanged. Any hope of expedient resolution of issues is gone. People who, often through no choice of their own, must deal with these bureaucracies will receive worst treatment and outcomes. Unpopular though the IRS may be, an IRS that can't function correctly is more dangerous to individuals and society than one that can.I'm struggling to think of any legitimate objection to the IRS that could be non-partisan.It's always been my daydream to work with a company like this and serve my country.At my current job I joined because it directly helps people as well by helping them shed off debt they cannot handle. We all do what we can to help others. Kudos to you!
                      
                  
      That's important! We have done some work on that around student loans: https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/what-if-you-could...If you're interested, consider applying!
                      
                  
      It's too bad that there aren't intern positions. Lots of DC students would be interested I'm sure.You might want to check out https://www.fedscoop.com/civic-digital-fellows-demo-day-2018... if you're looking for that!Any nontechnical roles ever come up? I'm at the e-Residency program in Estonia leading a team but definitely want to come back to the States and serve at some pointMost of our work involves engineers, designers, and product managers. Under the product category, there's also the notion of a "bureaucracy hacker" who helps get things done and launched. Those folks might not always be super technical, but are good at pushing to make forward progress.I am impressed with the work your team is doing!Has the current administration changed the work/mission/culture at all?We work on non-partisan projects, and the way we prioritize projects hasn't changed. So we're still able to get important things done for Veterans, small businesses, doctors/patients, students, immigrants, soldiers, etc.This is a recent overview of the sort of projects that we're working on: https://www.usds.gov/report-to-congress/2017/fall/ It's all great stuff that you'd feel proud to tell your family and friends about.
                      
                  
      > We work on non-partisan projects
As the existence and prioritization of executive branch projects is an outcome of partisan politics, that's only even possibly true in the sense that some government projects, even in this administration, aren't particularly subject to partisan controversy.
But while it would be possibly true in that sense, it doesn't seem to be actually true in that sense, as a review of the highlight projects at https://www.usds.gov/work shows that many serve goals that have been the subject of intense partisan controversy over the last couple years.
                      
                  
      This is interesting. I’m a veteran and know first hand how terrible the system can be.
I’ve taight myself JavaScript and have recently learned Django with my current position. I don’t have any plans to leave the company now, but working on systems that can help out fellow veterans more easily is tempting.
Maybe in a year or two I’ll revisit this :)
                      
                  
      You might consider applying. We're well-positioned to improve things at Veterans Affairs. I've had a Veteran say "I had trouble deciding about my GI Bill benefits. I'd like to build a tool to make it easier for other Veterans." And then they did!Check out this GI Bill comparison tool that Marc (the Veteran I mentioned) built: https://www.vets.gov/gi-bill-comparison-tool/ . Seeing vets help out brothers and sisters who have served is really inspiring.

      Command E | Lead Engineer (#1) | San Francisco, CA | Onsite/Remote | Full Time
We're building a next-generation search tool, and we're hiring employee #1—a lead engineer who wants to get in at the ground floor (pre-seed/seed stage). Both co-founders are engineers who worked at First Round Capital, Eventbrite, and Digg. We worked together at a top VC firm for 3 years and have a healthy mix of engineering skills + business sense. We’re looking for a unique engineer who is persistent, exploratory, multi-disciplinary, and demonstrates leadership.

Command E helps provides effortless, lightning-fast navigation of your chaotic workspace. Command E lets you instantly search your cloud data (i.e. Google Drive, Salesforce, Trello/Asana, Dropbox/Box, wikis, and more). We’re bringing the “fuzzy finder” file-switching experience of vi/Emacs/IDEs to business people. Our unique technology searches across many cloud providers and displays results as you type, in less than 10ms.

Our stack is Electron/React/Redux/SQLite. We’re using ES6, async/await, Promises, and all the cool new JavaScript stuff, but the search index is backed by rock-solid native SQLite/C++. From a technical perspective there's tons of fun space to explore—high-performance full-text search indexing, fast async UIs, modern dev frameworks, encryption, or deploying cross-platform desktop apps.

We're at 3rd & Market in San Francisco and have legendary VC/angel investors. We met each other 4 years ago through a "Who's Hiring?” thread, so we're excited to see who responds to this one!
There isn't much publicly available about us yet, but email benstandefer at gmail dot com and I'll share all the details.

      Netflix | Senior Software Engineer | Los Gatos, CA | ONSITE
How do we make our system more resilient? We find vulnerabilities and risks in our system before they lead to customer-facing outages. To find vulnerabilities, we build Chaos tools that allow us to inject events that we expect the system to handle, and check that the service stays healthy. We are currently leveraging these tools to build a platform for load testing services with production traffic. This platform allows us to better understand the limits of our production systems. Finally, we track patterns of risks and vulnerabilities, which inform us of our biggest availability challenges and help us come up with risk mitigation strategies.

      Nava | Infrastructure Engineers, Fullstack Software Engineers, Designers | Washington DC, San Francisco SF, New York NYC, REMOTE | On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k+ + equity + benefits | We're a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.
It turns out there’s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why we’re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteran’s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.
It’s surprising how much can be done by a small group of diverse, empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. We’ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable. If you feel the same way, we'd love to hear from you.

      Beckman Coulter Life Sciences | JavaScript or C# Engineers | SW Oregon | Full-time | Onsite
BC makes actual hardware products.  This group makes boxes that sniff air and tell you how clean it is.  Useful for microchip makers and especially drug companies.

We’re not a startup, which means you don’t have to deal with 20-something hotshots who have something to prove, all the while writing code for products that nobody will ever want.  We don’t work 12-hour days while pretending to have unlimited personal time.  It’s a mature company that treats its employees with respect and pays them well.  And it makes actual stuff that gets built and shipped out the door.

It also wants to stay relevant with the latest technologies and needs your skills to keep up with the workload.  We have 14 openings right now.  The average employee here is probably over 35, and over a decade of service.

Salary range?  I’m getting paid more here than I ever did in California, and my annual take-home starts with a 2.  You don’t have to take a pay cut to move here.  And holy @#$% does it go far.

Imagine, living in a small city with a surprising array of big-city amenities, beautiful mountains everywhere, where almost everyone’s nice, most men wear beards, and you can afford a house with a yard on a single income.  Maybe like the town you grew up in.  We’re 4 hours from Portland, so don’t worry about getting too much of that scene unless you want to.

After grinding it out in the SF bay area dystopia for years, I felt like I’d died and gone to heaven when I took this job.  If you do well on your resume and phone screen, BC will fly you out for a daylong onsite, which is really useful if you’re on your last dime after getting sucked dry by California rents.  How about leaving that scene behind?

      Karuna Health | San Francisco, CA USA | Full-time | Onsite
Without guidance, patients often feel anonymous, isolated, and helpless.

Around the country, teams of health guides, often called “care managers,” work directly with patients to guide them through the healthcare system. The impact these teams have is inspiring, but is expensive and difficult to scale.

At Karuna, we build software that automates common care care coordination tasks so that care management teams can get back to what they do best: being there for patients when they need help the most. We're led by repeat founders, advised by three of the most prominent healthcare leaders in the U.S., and backed by some of the best seed funds on earth (First Round, BoxGroup, etc.). Since day one, helping patients has been part of our DNA. One of our patients told us: "I wish you were available to me when I first started this journey, and I believe that this could be a game changer for battling [my] disease."

We're hiring for Full Stack and Back-end Engineer roles. Some details for both roles:

- Responsibility for bringing Karuna's vision to life. Your input is crucial to everything we build.

- Write code with a deeply technical eng team (co-founder / CTO and two product-focused full-stack engineers).

- Rapidly prototype new features, measure impact, and collaborate with experienced product lead to update our roadmap.

- Take us from demo to production level code as soon as we're experiencing traction.

Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071

About BBOXX

Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.

BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable solar energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 solar systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.

Hi! I'm one of the engineers on the team :)

If you're interested in:

- Being an active participant in the decision-making process of a YC company rapidly capitalizing on an under-the-radar market opportunity

- Applying your technical skills to a meaningful domain outside of tech (while learning about industry insider nuances), that has real-world medical implications

- Being part of a small engineering team that not only measures daily active users but also physical products shipped, revenues, and real profits

- Being part of a small engineering team that ships not only software products but also physical products

- Watching how changes in your code physically impacts the operation of not just machines but the IRL work-flow of real people (specifically, pharmacists and technicians)

- Hands-on shipping of product, end-to-end! Everything from ideation --> coding --> customer delight (& wash-rinse-repeat)

then I'd love to hear from you!

Our stack: React, Node, GraphQL (+ Apollo), ES6, Raspberry Pi, AWS (RDS, ECS, CloudFront, EC2), Elasticsearch, Jenkins, Rails, Python, Linux (Ubuntu), Docker, and moar. Right tool for the job > dogma.

We have deliberately avoided press coverage around our traction, investors, and market because we have been focused on taking over the market as quickly as possible, but we will going public with what we're up to shortly in a few weeks! (I'm sorry there's no web site or company name to google for just yet--but I promise this isn't at all anywhere close to the pejorative "stealth" mode at work)

We're in the pharmacy (not pharmaceutical) space and I'm happy to elaborate more in private for serious inquiries.

We offer competitive Bay Area salary, stock equity, healthcare insurance, and other employee benefits.

      Spring Discovery | Data Scientist / Applied ML | Full-Time | Bay Area
Spring Discovery is applying machine learning to accelerate the discovery of therapies for aging and its many related diseases. Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases — by understanding and treating the biological damage accumulated as we age, we can find powerful new therapies for fighting disease and living healthier, longer lives.

Over the past few decades, an unignorable amount of evidence has piled up from the best labs in the world that this is possible [1]. But translating the science to real therapies has been challenging in a field that has historically struggled to experiment quickly. Here’s more on our mission and approach: https://medium.com/spring-discovery/accelerating-the-discove...

We have deep support from top-notch investors, including General Catalyst, First Round, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Felicis, Sam Altman, and more. And our advisory board includes both world leaders in aging research and senior pharma execs.

We have the beginnings of a great data pipeline (already several TB of rich biological data collected specifically for ML purposes) and are building out our own lab to accelerate data acquisition even more. We’re looking now to add to our early team with experienced data scientists or applied ML engineers who would enjoy working on things ranging from data infrastructure to modelling to statistical analysis of large datasets. Yes, you belong even if you don't have a bio background — we're a cross-functional team. (Although of course biology experience is a plus).

  - https://careers.ibm.com/ShowJob/Id/416940/?lang=en (data scientist)Hi blparker,
I'll be graduating this May 2019 from the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities with dual BS degrees in Computer Science and Statistical Science. For the past 6 months I've been interning at a commerce analytics company where I built a RESTful web service in Python 3.7, and prior to that I worked at the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute where I gained experience with various big data frameworks.

The software engineering position sounds like it'd be a great fit for me given my statistics background. I also have experience applying/designing machine learning models and completed the graduate level ML classes at the U of M.

Asking candidly, would it be worth it for me to apply? Or is this position not open to new graduates? I am very interested and I'd love to discuss this opening with you more by phone or email, if possible.

Best,
~Mark

The requirements are: a good background in mathematics and statistics, and a deep interest in language and linguistics. Programming skill is a huge plus, but not an absolute requirement.

I believe we are poised to make a huge dent in the world of NLP and linguistics. The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank). In my research I've discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. I've spent the last couple of years validating the approach, and now that I'm confident it works, I'm looking to build up a team.

I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won't appeal to everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also. I can also guarantee that you will get a ton of great experience that you would be tough to get at a big company. I want to especially encourage the following types of people to reach out:

- Recent grads in technical fields who want to break into the software engineering industry

- People who have had some success in mainstream software engineering careers, but are now bored and want to try something new

- People who want are thinking about going to graduate school in CS/ML/AI/NLP and want some experience doing research in that area
I'm happy to talk more about the specifics in person. Email me at daniel dot burfoot at gmail.

We look for a senior DevOps engineer (5+ years experience) to join our team who develops and operates the TeraLab platfom https://www.teralab-datascience.fr/ . For about 5 years, TeraLab has hosted more than 60 innovation, research and education projects in the data domain (big data, AI, blockchain …). Most often with open source technologies, we address  cloud, distributed and secured architectures, cloud provisioning and configuration automation, datascience environment setup (linux, shorewall, nginx, openVpn QEMU/KVM,Docker, Kubernetes, Hadoop/spark, Cassandra, Mongodb, influxdb, ElasticSearch, Pyton/scikitlearn, R, tensor flow, Grafana, Ansible, Zabbix, gitlab….).
We restitute experience from/to our projects contacts (from large companies, SME, startups, researchers, students) and providers/partners
Given our small team size (currently 4 persons excluding physical infrastructure), you as the engineers in place are expected to address all the platform components and activities.

- autonomous, responsible, thoroughTempo Automation | Full-Stack Software Engineer | SF | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://www.tempoautomation.com
Tempo operates a factory in SF to produce printed circuit boards extremely quickly - in doing so, we give our customers the physical equivalent of a fast compiler, enabling them to turn their designs into real products significantly faster than they could before. Our customers build rockets, drones, medical devices, and much more - working at Tempo means you can accelerate all of these industries at once. Providing a system to produce circuit boards quickly and correctly means we're both a software shop and an advanced manufacturer. Our software team is still pretty small (9 engineers) which means any new hires will still have an outsize impact on the direction of our technology, and on the company as a whole. We love hiring strong generalists [python experience highly preferred] who take initiative and act as part-time PMs when they're working on projects. Some projects you might work on:


  - Offering real-time, automated manufacturing feedback based on certain parameters of our customers' designs. Think linting for hardware.

  - Optimizing our factory processes with machine learning and scheduling algorithms.

  - Encoding the three-dimensional structure of each order's components (e.g. resistors, capacitors) for our assembly robots, in order to speed up assembly and ensure minimal manufacturing defects.

  - Optimizing our automated optical inspection machine to make it faster than any in the industry.

You'll be adding new features to Fantastical and Cardhop, as well as hunting for bugs and helping to keep everything running smoothly for our users. Areas you'll be working on include UI/UX development, databases, networking (including CalDAV, Exchange Web Services, and other APIs), and more – across macOS, iOS, and watchOS.

- Web backend/frontend engineer

This is not a purely frontend or backend role. Think of it as a roughly 60/20/20 split between backend/frontend/ops. You'll be helping us build the server and web infrastructure for a future Flexibits product as well as helping ensure that CI/CD and deployments work smoothly on GCP and Kubernetes. This involves being flexible and willing to learn about different technologies with the aim of building something great for our users.

      https://FlowerCompany.com | Cannabis Wholesale Membership Club | VP Engineering, Comptroller | SF/East Bay | On Site
FlowerCompany is a wholesale membership delivery service that connects consumers directly to Humboldt County farmers. Members order over the weekend for pre-scheduled delivery the following Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday with a 90-minute delivery window.

Membership starts at $79/year and members generally save ~40% on any purchase. Taxes on cannabis are as high as 38% in certain areas, so by lowering product prices, consumers save a lot of money on taxes too.

We're only 6 months old but we are scaling fast. We have 20 billboards up in SF this month and will be expanding across the state within the next 6-12 months.

If you're interested, please email scarlet@flowercompany.com with your resume.
Thank you.

Synthesis could eventually enable access to code for non-programmers. For now, goal is simple: My customers give me source code for their contract (= Ethereum apps, which are self-contained). I use synthesis to generate another contract/app that demonstrates any problematic interaction.

Namebase is a top-level domain registrar and exchange for the Handshake blockchain. Namebase makes it easy for anyone to buy/sell Handshake coins (HNS) and use their HNS to register TLDs.-- Why should you care?
The internet wasn't built to handle the scale it supports today. The DNS we rely on is supported by ducktape solutions that fail to serve the security and reliability needs of today's internet. For instance, compromised Certificate Authorities threaten SSL (https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/certificate-authority-vulner...), and domains get seized for arbitrary reasons, even for good actors (https://twitter.com/zoho/status/1044249648993525760?s=20).
Handshake fixes these issues by letting anyone register secure, censorship-resistant TLDs on the blockchain. More details can be found in the whitepaper https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt.

Namebase is driving adoption of Handshake's DNS by making it easier to use and more powerful.

We are looking for an experienced frontend engineer to join our team of 4 including 2 engineers.

We don't require experience with our tech stack, just the motivation and ability to learn. For more details on the role, email me and I'd love to tell you more - Tieshun, tieshun at namebase.io, Namebase CEO

We are a software consultancy known for pragmatism, autonomy, expertise, and trust.

As a Truss engineer you will facilitate bringing Truss values (https://truss.works/values/) to those truly trying to make a difference in our government, and enable them to understand what their citizens actually need rather than implementing a perceived solution.

* Great communication! Including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing
* The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy
* Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools
* Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc.
* Experience deploying at least one application that other people use
* Have held at least one engineering position post-education
* Initiative, curiosity, a bias for action, and a problem-solving attitude

Storj develops an open-source, decentralized cloud storage platform called Storj (pronounced storage) that is disrupting the cloud storage market.

We rent unused hard drive space from users all over the globe, operating active storage nodes on every continent (except Antarctica). Our core target is selling to software developers and channel partners who get higher quality, privacy, and security at 1/6th the price.

      Energotest | Gliwice (Poland) | Full Time | ONSITE | Senior Software Engineer | http://www.energotest.com.pl/index/kariera
Energotest is a modern and well organized engineering company with a team of distinguished specialists. Many of them have managed or co-managed: design, assembly supervision, post-assembly tests, start-up of devices and electrical power engineering systems, practically in all newly erected or modernized power plants, combined heat and power plants, substations and industrial plants in Poland and abroad.

The Energotest R&D department team is looking for a senior developer who would be willing to take part in setting new directions in the development of systems for the broader "Industry 4.0". The person will help us change the world of automation systems, face the task of creating tools for engineers and firmware for devices manufactured by Energotest. Working together in the R&D department, we are happy to share our knowledge, but the ability to independently solve problems and look for information will be a desirable skill. If you have skills that do not meet all of the following requirements, but enter other areas of programming and feel that they will help develop our project or make it a unique product, we will gladly talk to you. Currently we are building a device (based on embedded Linux) and some tools to configure it (with C++/Qt).

Essential skills: GNU/Linux, Git, Bash, C++, Boost, Qt

Nice to have (in random order):

* Python (and Boost.Python)

* Experience with embedded Linux (yocto)

* Modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17)

* Functional programming (Haskell, Erlang)

* Web technologies (Elm, PureScript)

Extra notes:

* It doesn't harm if you also know MFC, C#, Delphi and Windows in general

* Official language in Energotest is Polish

* Remote work is partly possible (1 day/week)
If you want to avoid the recruitment path, take on the challenge available here: https://energotest.github.io/Challenge/

      Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers...). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Square Cash, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of remote, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but work from anywhere they want.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:
- You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.
- You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.
- You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.
- You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.
- You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
- You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

      Facet Development | Remote | Ex-FAANG engineers (Full Stack, Front End, and everything else)
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post here or not - we aren't a recruiting firm or job board. We are a home for freelancers/contractors and we have several openings.

Facet Development is a freelancer network made up exclusively of ex-FAANG engineers. Facet does the work of finding freelancing jobs/projects and then we send them out to the devs in the network. We also provide project management and billing/collections, help with taxes, etc, so freelancers get to spend a lot more of their time doing the enjoyable parts of freelancing and not trying to run a small business.

We target FAANG companies and companies that wish they could hire FAANG devs when finding work for our freelancer network. When I was a dev lead at Microsoft, bringing on vendors or outsourcing was a terrible experience, because they always seemed to be below our hiring bar. So I started Facet to solve the problem I had when I was an engineering manager at a FAANG company.

If you are a FAANG or ex-FAANG dev that wants to switch to freelancing or already is, you should join: https://www.facetdev.com/developer-network

About me: I'm an engineering manager started as an engineer here at Uber, in Amsterdam. My first project was rewriting the Uber app (https://eng.uber.com/new-rider-app/) and the last interesting piece of code I committed was open sourcing the architecture behind it (https://github.com/uber/RIBs). I recently shared some things that I’ve learned about distributed systems, while building the payments systems at Uber, which was quite popular here, on HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16852295)

Full Stack Engineer | Front-end Engineer

One of the biggest pain points when working with Big Data is that the data is stored across multiple sources and data warehousing is expensive and doesn't allow you to work on the data easily.  At Dremio we are solving this by offering a Data as a Service platform - allowing analysts and data scientists to work with large sets of data no matter where and how they are stored.

We heavily contribute to and use several open source projects like Apache Arrow to achieve this and are hiring engineers.  We are looking for both front-end engineers and full-stack engineers (we use Java on the backend) to help grow our product.

      ChatLingual | Senior Full-Stack Developer (Node.js) | Denver, Colorado | Full-Time | ONSITE

Knotel | multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://knotel.com
Knotel is a fast growing commercial real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.

Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.

As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are building internal tools to increase our efficiency as a company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.

In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to solve.

We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.

Today we're hiring a whole bunch of roles:

At Quora, we use Machine Learning in almost every part of the product - feed ranking, answer ranking, search, topic and user recommendations, spam detection, etc. Within the past few months we released a large question sincerity dataset [1], improved our statistical tests for ratio metrics [2], and introduced a new feature that allows people to curate collections and form communities around shared interests and tastes [3].

As a Machine Learning expert, you will have a unique opportunity to have high impact by advancing these systems, as well as uncovering new opportunities to apply Machine Learning to the Quora product. As a ML Infrastructure Expert, you will play a key role in developing tools and abstractions that our other developers would build on top of.

      Magic | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | Full-stack | Engineering
Magic (http://getmagic.com) is a Y-Combinator and Sequoia-backed software company in San Francisco, CA that is building a hyper-intelligent, ubiquitous assistant available over SMS, email, chat apps, and other digital channels. Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...

But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t "sudo cancel my Comcast subscription" but you can "magic cancel my Comcast subscription." It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.

Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters. We don't stop until we are done.

Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.

We are currently hiring for senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.

Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.

Bonus points if you've got...
- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks
- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins
- Experience within early-stage startups or human operations companiesApply here: https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hn

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

This person will work to empower other backend engineers, help us build a better devops culture, and will have the opportunity to work on deep technical problems at the intersection of backend, devops, and tooling.

On the company side, we're a fully distributed team with people in 5 time zones (4 in the US and 1 in Europe). We're also a profitable, mostly bootstrapped company that prides itself on growing deliberately and empowering students. We hold company offsites 2 to 3 times a year and even enjoy meeting with our students in person at these events.

Here's a preview of the requirements for this position:

* 5+ years of backend infrastructure experience

* 3+ years of Python experience

* Experience with Docker & Kubernetes

* Experience creating on-call rotations

* Experience working on a team with strong devops culture

Technology has made the world more connected, fundamentally changing how we live, work and interact; yet traditional schools have not evolved to prepare students for the 21st century. Replacing textbooks with tablets won’t be enough. We believe schools need a new foundation. That’s why we’re building a web-based school scheduling platform, that allows administrators to put master schedules and daily calendars into a single cloud-based system. We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools. We are also a company that deeply values diversity in every way.

Personal note: I've been on the Abl engineering team for a little over a year and I love it. The mission and the team make coming into work _awesome_. We have a diverse team, we're well funded, we have experienced leadership... I could go on. The interview process is, in my opinion, very fair. You won't be asked to white board and we understand that the process is just as much the candidate getting to know the company as it is the other way around.

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Data Scientist:

The Role

We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff. You’ll collaborate with a team of product designers, engineers, and school leaders to build software features that help schools overcome complex logistical challenges.

As a Data Scientist at Abl, your work will immediately improve equity in and operations of schools across the country. You will collaborate with product designers to determine what to build and prototype, with engineers to deploy software into production use, and with our schools team to provide decision support for K12 principals who are implementing novel solutions to complex scheduling problems.

Recent data science projects include:
Defining and calculating measures of inequity for students within a school schedule
Building recommendations for course placement in a schedule
Proposing and prototyping algorithms for supporting team teaching best practices
Developing metrics and visualizations for student tracking
The Team

Our product research and development team is small, passionate, and inclusive. You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.

As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.

Responsibilities

+ Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, and predictive models)

+ Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl’s product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production

+ Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling

+ Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools

+ Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources

+ Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate

+ Determine how to evaluate equity, or fairness, for students and for teachers

+ Propose metrics for evaluating the overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules’ ability to meet school leader priorities

+ Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school data

Qualifications

+ Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)

+ Proficiency in writing SQL queries

+ Ability and desire to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences (e.g., in writing, through reporting tools, and at in-person presentations)

+ Experience with cleaning, structuring, and transforming data via ETL processes

+ Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Front-End Engineer:

Your Impact

+ Work collaboratively with the Product and Design team to understand the experiences and pain points of schools, teachers, and students

+ Define and build compelling new products and exciting new features that give educators insights that will enable them to optimize how they use their resources

+ Use your extensive knowledge of front-end technologies to build high-quality designs that are scalable

+ Manage code review, increase performance, and communicate best front-end engineering practices

+ Create a first of its kind interface that will progress K-12 schools and their communities

Qualifications

+ Experience with Javascript frameworks such as React, Backbone, Angular etc.

+ You should have a great feel for user experience and an eye for beautiful designs

+ Bring a deep understanding of best practices in design, optimization, interaction, and usability

+ Familiarity with the whole web stack, including protocols and web server optimization techniques

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Backend Engineer

Qualifications

+ B.S. degree in computer science or equivalent work experience

+ Strong fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering

+ Familiarity with server-side frameworks like Ruby on Rails

+ Experience building large scale distributed systems and networked services

Your Impact

+ Help set the direction of our company and product

+ Measurably improve student outcomes

+ Improve the lives of teachers

+ Help spread new, innovative school models

+ Give schools greater visibility into how they use their time and resources, enabling them to better support their students and teachers

      DrivenData Labs | Software Engineer (Python) With Focus On Data Applications | Berkeley, CA | FULL-TIME, ONSITE | http://drivendata.co
-- OVERVIEW --

DrivenData brings the transformative power of data science to organizations tackling the world's biggest challenges. We run online machine learning challenges with social impact, and we work directly with mission-driven organizations to drive change through machine intelligence and analytics.

We are looking for a talented software engineer who is interested in using their job to take on tough social challenges, while growing their data acumen and building real-world applications. As a core member of a small team your role will include managing code development, brainstorming approaches to engineering problems, working closely with data science and machine learning developers, and taking an open and constructive mindset to getting things done across multiple projects. You'll work directly with data scientists that started their careers as software engineers, bringing an experienced understanding of software processes alongside opportunities to learn new quant skills, tools, and ways of approaching data applications.

-- ROLE --

This is a software developer role ideal for a Python engineer with 3-5 years of professional experience who is interested in data (possibly looking to transition into data engineering or data science). Advanced proficiency in Python and comfort with Linux a necessity. Good opportunity to learn the quant skills necessary to work in the data space. No need to have a background in math or a CS degree, but the job will involve a lot of quantitative thinking so the applicant should not be afraid of math.

Working on a small team means doing a little bit of a lot of things. We're looking for somebody who can ask the right questions to figure out what is important, iterate between brainstorming together and working independently, and exercise sound engineering judgment to make reasonable decisions under conditions of ambiguity.

Doing client-facing work involves turning uncertainty into a reasonable path forward. As a team, we value arguments for how to proceed based on evidence, and we want somebody who will present their opinion and engage in a discussion around the best way forward.

Here are some of the things you'd be doing on an ordinary day:

- Internal software development: Maintain our Django codebase for drivendata.org, fix bugs, add features, safely refactor and maintain test coverage. Develop new internal tooling and improve on existing apps.

- Client-facing software development. Build a variety of applications, generally small green-field proofs of concept. Quickly learn and adopt new technologies on demand based on client needs; a typical engagement may include at least one data technology we haven't all worked with before (e.g. Elasticsearch, Apache Storm, Cassandra).

- Light DevOps Tasks

-- REQUIREMENTS --

Critical skills: Python (advanced), Linux (advanced), SQL (intermediate to advanced). Must be able to learn quickly by reading appropriate documentation in order to write clean, idiomatic code.

Nice to have: Experience using IaaS like Amazon AWS or PaaS like Heroku. Experience using Docker. Exposure to big data tools like Spark or Hadoop, or familiarity with the underlying ideas like MapReduce.
