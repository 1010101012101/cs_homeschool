I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with react, nodejs, go and noticed them in the post.
I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM
