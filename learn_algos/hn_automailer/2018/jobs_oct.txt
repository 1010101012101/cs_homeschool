Render (https://render.com) | San Francisco, CA | Software Engineers and Designers | Full-time | All visas except new H-1Bs | Onsite
When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.

Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new classes of applications.

We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and Postgres, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for people with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.

We're serving live applications in production and building our founding engineering and design teams in SF. The company is backed by the same investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe, as well as the former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox.

I'm the founder and would love to hear from you if this sounds interesting. You can apply here: https://render.com/jobs

Two reasons:
1. Given the limited number of H1-Bs, there's only a ~35% chance we'll be able to get the application approved.

2. New H-1B applications will only be accepted in April 2019, but we're looking to hire now.

We are seeking a Full Stack Developer to become an integral part of our drug design team! You will be responsible for spearheading the development of our distributed internal simulation platform.

We're an early-stage startup and thus you will be working closely with our CTO and CSO on extending and developing our internal simulation platform, both on the frontend and backend. The simulation platform analyzes and visualizes data that is collected from the compute nodes. To address our scaling needs, and to leverage our resources efficiently, the platform runs on a heterogenous mix of cloud and internal nodes. To handle the complexity, you will rely on tools like containerization to cope with the different environments. While emphasis is made on data collection, preservation and internal system maintenance, your role will also involve the use of public databases and APIs, visualization, scraping, development of JS tools and UX design.

Software Engineering Institute (SEI) | Compiler Researcher | Pittsburgh, PA, USA | ONSITE
Our team is developing techniques for automatically repairing C source code to remove memory-safety vulnerabilities. The ultimate goal is to enable a proof of some or all aspects of memory safety of the repaired program. By repairing at the level of source code (as opposed to a compiler pass, like AddressSanitizer or SoftBound+CETS), the user isn’t tied to a particular build chain. Furthermore, although the goal is to as automatic as possible, nevertheless it is likely that the developer will need to manually tune performance-critical sections of the codebase, which is facilitated by doing the repair at the source-code level.

We are looking to hire someone with experience in static analysis, compiler development, or formal verification. The successful candidate will both work on advanced research projects and work directly with customers to help transition our research into practice. Candidates will be subject to a background check and must be eligible to obtain and maintain a Department of Defense security clearance.

If interested, please email your resume to me at weklieber+hiring@sei(DOT)cmu(DOT)edu.

CareStack | Senior/Principal Frontend Developer | Full-Time | ONSITE preferred, REMOTE possible | Cambridge, MA | https://carestack.com
CareStack is a dental practice management SaaS. We're helping dentists capture hundreds of thousands of dollars more than with legacy tools through schedule optimization and improved claims management--and no, that's not just hype, it's real. We've just landed a $16M Series A, led by Accel, Eight Roads Ventures and F-Prime Capital Partners, and we're expanding our development team from India to the United States. The company has product-market fit and our onboarding pipeline has filled up nicely. Now it's up to the engineering team to really turn the product into something special--something that our customers are delighted to pay us for. Having that kind of product-market fit so early and reducing a lot of it to technical problems is a different situation than a lot of startups at this stage, but it makes things a whole lot more fun.

Right now, we're in need of product-minded senior and principal-level frontend developers who have a track record of making sustainable long-term decisions. Our stack is .NET (though .NET experience isn't required) and Angular 1/TypeScript; the future of the usual frontend may be a modern version of Angular or a move to React, and it's largely up to the leaders of our frontend team to decide. (Our mobile work will probably be React Native.) In addition to technical and architectural competence, a big part of the role is helping to socialize good practices to our existing developer base as well as to forge ahead with the usual: new features, performance and stability improvements, and the like.

As for me, I'm the Director of Infrastructure here--I was impressed enough by the company and the team to wind down my consulting business to come here. For those of you who know me from HN, you know that I'm big on generosity, kindness, and competence, and I'm happy to say that this team is better at all of the above than any team I've ever worked with in the past. We all teach; we all learn. It is a pleasure to come into work everyday.

Our team is primarily Boston-centric--I was the first engineer hired into this office, we're up to 7 local now. We do offer relocation for the right candidates and we will consider remote hires.

The Nylas Cloud APIs (https://nylas.com) makes it an order of magnitude easier for companies to add email, calendar, and contacts integrations to their applications. By being at the core of business communication, scheduling, and contacts, we believe we can shape the future of how people work.

We’re looking for Site Reliability Engineers to join our team to help build and scale the infrastructure our platform runs on and the tools our developers need to get work done. Our SRE team is responsible for the infrastructure layer of our API platform—the base operating system (including security), CI/CD & deployment tools, monitoring and observability tools, and our horizontally sharded data storage layer which stores tens of terabytes of data.

At Nylas, “DevOps” is a part of our engineering culture, not a role we’re looking to fill. Our development team shares the pager with operations and makes their own deploys.

Our stack: Python, MySQL, Redis, AWS, Debian

About you:

- You have 3 - 5 years of production engineering experience

- You are located anywhere in US timezones - we have offices in San Francisco and NYC and this team contains remote members

- You value communication and empathy as much as technical prowess

- You have experience automating systems using any modern configuration management system (Chef, Ansible, Puppet)

- You have experience running services on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure)

- You can write reliable code in at least one scripting language (Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript etc.), though this won’t be a focus of our interview process

- You’re excited to create a modern, scalable infrastructure and automate away drudgery

We wrote about our values, benefits, perks, and published them in our open-source handbook (https://github.com/nylas/handbook). You can also find more details at: https://www.keyvalues.com/nylas

Blackbird Studios | Lead Fullstack Developer | San Francisco | Onsite or Remote* | Contract to hire Blackbird Studios is a full service digital product studio. We specialize in a holistic approach inspired by HCD and Lean. Services include CTO consulting, product strategy, engagement strategy, UX/UI, and development plus long term BML iterations and maintenance. We work with large and small companies/startups on projects ranging from 1-6 months with 2-6 people on each project.
We build full stack web, mobile, physical installations, etc. Our favorite stack is React/Redux, GraphQL, Rails, and React Native. We also use a wide range of other tech as needed since we face a pretty diverse set of challenges. Recent and upcoming examples: Elixir/Phoenix, .Net, C++/Qt, embedded Linux, Native iOS/Swift, Native Android/Kotlin.

Working at Blackbird is very different from larger product companies. We operate in very strategic relationships with our clients which gives us a unique opportunity every few months to deep dive into a new interesting understanding of our client's business and build ground up new apps where everyone is making major and early contributions.

We are looking for a Lead Developer with extensive experience in dev team leadership, new product development, and collaboration with business and design stakeholders. Serious consulting experience is also a huge plus. Specific skills ideally include our favorite stack (at least very interested in learning) plus (ideally) knowledge of either native iOS or Android. As a senior Blackbird team member, occasional travel to San Francisco and other locations is part of the job for project kickoffs and other critical collaboration phases or meetings. In a given month this can be anywhere from no travel up to a couple days every week or occasionally an entire week on site with a client.

I am a founder so ask me anything! If there are other aspects of what we do that interest you definitely still hit me up!

ONSITE / Boston, MA / radix.bio / VISA SPONSOR / SCALA ENGINEER / 90-150k / EQUITY
At Radix, we build a compiler and operating system for the computer architecture expressed by a biology lab. We do this to allow biologists to disseminate their work in a runnable form to other labs. We're currently hiring Scala engineers to help us with this. Our entire stack is in Scala, from our compiler to our graphical UI for biologists to our device drivers. We interface with sensors and lab equipment to provide abstractions that allow biologists to write their lab protocols as formal programs, constraining the acceptable environmental conditions in their protocol, which we check at compile time to provide error logs and insight into why protocols may not reproduce.

If you enjoy formal logic, theorem provers, user experience design, or driver development, we really like those too. Parts of how our product works are technically awesome, with some cutting edge research into theorem prover optimization and heuristic generation making our product possible.

We've just cleared our Seed round, with investors like MIT's The Engine, Y Combinator, and Firstminute capital. We're a rapidly growing team that could use a person like you. Even if you don't meet all of our requirements, we're happy to talk and see if we can work together.

Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071

About BBOXX

Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.

BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable solar energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 solar systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.

This is a well paid opportunity in a high-growth and high-quality team.

We are a true "engineering over management" culture where you find engineers both with formal computer science background and also ones, who are self-taught.

Our CTO worked with Erich Gamma, got offers from Apple, Google and similar firms but instead of making it big in Silicon Valley, he stayed in Zurich to build the engineering team.

We currently building tailored web apps with heavy number crunching on the server - e.g., we built the software analyzing all the weather data in Switzerland for "Meteo Schweiz". We do custom development with a heavy engineering part and we regularly impress our clients with software that "just works" and rarely needs maintenance.

Also, we are building a web layer between legacy BPM software and the web. One vertical we are launching soon is a SaaS product for Yoga studios.

People say our interview process is pleasant:

1) Phone screen with our CTO

2) Two sessions of remote pair-programming with our engineers (no Google-like algorithmic questions but reasonable pair-programming tasks).

3) Onsite half a day with us.

Lots of YC companies | Software engineers of all kinds | Many places, though mostly in the US | Mostly on-site, but some remote | Full-time and intern
Earlier this year, a team of us at Y Combinator started a "common app", so that people could apply to work all Y Combinator companies at once. It seemed silly to us that even though so many companies are struggling to hire people, it still requires O(n) effort to apply to n companies.

So, we built https://workatastartup.com. It's a simple way to apply to all YC companies at the same time. Right now it's only for software engineers & data scientists for now (we hope to open it more broadly later). If a company is interested, you'll get an email from them. There is also a directory where you can browse the jobs of some of the companies that are actively hiring through the site and apply directly (not all companies have finished their director profile yet).

It seems to be working pretty well so far - many of the people who posted a profile have gotten more than a dozen company founders reaching out to them, and people have gotten jobs through it. You're most likely to have good results if you're looking for a full-time role in the US since that's where most YC companies are based.

We recently hosted an in-person career fair where the founders of ~40 YC companies from a variety of fields and of various sizes gave short presentations and then mingled with attendees. [0, 1]

We'd love if you filled out a profile and let us know what you think (workatastartup@ycombinator.com) : https://www.workatastartup.com

Scientist | Software Engineer & Data Scientist | San Diego | Full-time | REMOTE | https://scientist.com
What we do: Scientist.com is a growing services marketplace which helps Scientists the world-over find, initiate, and track service requests. We're at many of the largest pharmaceutical and biotech institutions in the world. We enable the outsourced workflows which increase efficiencies and facilitate compliance. And we're growing.

What you would do: The web application is in great shape but we need to answer more business questions. We want to provide data and tools to our finance and business analysts based on events from the application. The first big project would be maintaining an ETL pipeline for loading data in to AWS Redshift and supporting our internal customers with Quicksight or Tableau.

You would be collaborating with experienced application owners who know the datas ins and outs, you would not be learning the system in a vacuum. That won't be the end of it, we'd also like to support more developer friendly tools like Jupyter.

You'd also be supporting the Kubernetes cluster, helping to track system health, improving our CI/CD system, internal metrics and logging, performing cluster upgrades, and doing a variety of security ops. I think this part is more minor but any experience with operating Kubernetes is desired. If you like Rust, this also a great job for you, I'd love to have utilities or even small webapps written in Rust.

Alpha Ears | Computational Geometry Scientist | Brooklyn/NYC, New York, USA | Full-time | Onsite+Remote, in town preferred
Hi, my name is Tarik, I am the founder of Alpha Ears. I have gotten recently into the 3D printing space by designing and selling accessories for Boosted Boards and am now starting a more ambitious business with the goal to make a splash into the custom earphones/hearing protection space. Getting to the audiologist is time-consuming and expensive, preventing most people from benefitting from the never-going-back custom earphones experience, as well as being able to easily order earplugs for sleep, swimming, or filters for concerts, flying etc. that are custom made. Some startups have tried and failed, often not shipping or landing to market with electronics that are out of date or with a still cumbersome ordering process. I want to start simple and focus on the customer ordering and delivery process with a single product: custom inserts for Airpods.

I have already designed and made prototypes for a case that works with the Airpods case as well as an insert for my ears. I am looking for an expert in computational geometry with computer vision and machine learning dabs, to help develop a process to automatically evaluate and process scan meshes, as well as algorithmically generate product files by combining the scan with the parametric design.

This is a position that I am looking to evolve into a co-founder position for the right person.

This saves everyone involved time, money, and water. Through our "Save Water | Give Life" initiative, we dedicate a portion of our proceeds to clean water initiatives, building drinking water wells in developing countries (https://www.weathermatic.com/our-cause/).

Our office is in Garland, TX, but our software team works remotely most of the time, just meeting at the office for planning meetings, etc.

We run a core web application in Ruby on Rails, with the field-communication parts written in Go. The system can also be accessed via our React Native based mobile application. Deployed using Docker via AWS ECS, AWS Lambda, and other associated services.

We are a small team looking for someone who can contribute at all levels of the project, even including firmware and test fixture design if that's interesting to you! Lots of opportunity to make a difference and work with a variety of interesting technologies.

WaiveCar | Programmer, Engineer, Designer | Santa Monica, California | Onsite | full-time
WaiveCar was one of the first companies in the current urban mobility revolution. I'm a recent CTO and also the person that's referenced at the top of these monthly post for the past few years. We've had a few companies that have unicorned out of Santa Monica, essentially based on our idea. FireflyOn, the people who put screens on top of ubers, had us in their slidedeck. We've got a number of attack vectors and partnerships in our response and need more resources to execute them.

Our users love us and we have somewhat of a cult following. Now it's time to grow the cult. I'm authoring our revolution round 2 and this time we're not going to let it slip away by Bird and Lime like the last one.

I'm trying to (as of about a week ago) now aggressively build a large team so we scale or fail. We're changing our strategy and you can be a part of it. Here's a partial list of people we need:

* Solid mobile app developers

* Backend or full-stack

* Designers

* Hardware specialists with EE experience

* Mechanical Engineers to help build the next-gen of our screens

We're in a large system-wide overhaul and removing all the anti-scaling valves we have in place. I need people who want to aggressively move products forward and think big.

We offer competitive salaries and all that, sure. But if you just want a job, go elsewhere. You need to have a unwavering passion to build infrastructure. I'm here to kick ass and you should be too.

How to apply: Email me chris(at)waive.car. Text or call me 657 210 1337. Don't be shy.

Let's do this.

Retool | SF, ONSITE
Hi! We're Retool (https://tryretool.com) - a fast way to build internal tools. We recently launched on HN (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17725966). We're profitable, growing quickly, and have raised money from great technical founders, including Paul Graham, John + Patrick Collison, Nat Friedman, Greg Brockman, etc.

We've significantly de-risked the business (good signals of early pmf, completed 10+ unaffiliated sales via cold email, are profitable, etc.). But there's plenty of uncertainty left as well. For example: how do we convert early pmf into actual pmf? How do we scale sales? Should we be doing sales or marketing? Should we be selling to technical or non-technical people?

The market for custom enterprise apps is huge. And we think that we have a promising shot at capturing much of it: we have a product that works, that customers love (ping me for a list of customers), and whose usage is growing rapidly.

We're looking engineers (full-stack) and AEs (ideally with some experience selling SaaS software). You’ll be talking to customers multiple times a day, no matter what the role. Since we’re still early, you’re also welcome to learn about other aspects of the business, like marketing, sales, or whatever else.

If you're interested, please email me at dh@tryretool.com. Thanks!

OrbitalRx | Sr. Fullstack or Frontend Engineer | Full-Time | ONSITE | Raleigh, NC | www.orbitalrx.com
At OrbitalRx, we are a highly collaborative, respectful, and inclusive team focused on building software products for hospital pharmacists to deal with the growing and very serious problem of medication shortages. Pharmacy in hospitals is kind of like devops in software: the rest of the organization only notices them when something goes wrong, such as a drug not being available when it’s needed.

We can’t change the fact that drug shortages happen; the causes range from weather to politics to business. But we can help hospital pharmacy teams be more effective in finding creative ways to get patients the treatments and medications they need.

We are currently a team of three: two seasoned hospital pharmacy leaders and a technology leader (that's me) with experience building software for hospitals. We’re seeking developers to join our early team and help bring our product development to the next level.

Our stack is Python/Django, React.js, PostgreSQL-flavored Aurora, and some AWS-specific stuff. If you feel like you want to help solve a real and meaningful problem, and can take on a broad range of coding responsibility, please take a look at our position descriptions, and contact us if there's one that looks good to you.

About us

Gravitational, an early stage systems & cloud startup in San Francisco, is looking for ambitious and talented people. We are well-funded by fantastic Silicon Valley investors. We are an experienced team: we founded Mailgun [1] which was acquired by Rackspace, we created Vulcand [2] and some other cool stuff [3] at Rackspace and are authors of Teleport [4] and Teleconsole [5].

We are hackers. We love Linux and low level systems programming and we love helping open source communities and other engineers to get things done. Our stack is 100% Linux and Golang with JavaScript/React for dynamic web front-ends.

We offer competitive compensation and benefits (including a founder shares equity grant, platinum level healthcare insurance, commuter benefits and a stocked kitchen).

About you

For this role we're looking for a generalist full-stack software engineer, preferably located in Toronto, Canada (but we're willing to consider exceptional candidates elsewhere). You understand how computers work and what role an operating system plays? You know why the Linux kernel is written in C and not any other language? Most likely we'll want to talk to you.

Responsibilities

Gravitational builds tools for developers, we are not a SaaS company but we still need to develop web apps. You will own the development & maintenance of the customer portal, the web site, the blog and other web applications that we're running.

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parser generators, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.

Very Good Security (VGS) is the easiest, most secure, and most compliant way to collect, protect, and exchange sensitive data on the internet. We are building a very developer-friendly way to embed privacy into both existing and new applications today.

To quote a Forbes reporter: "Startups, such as Very Good Security (VGS), are building new cloud services so that smaller firms across the economy can offer products with leading edge privacy protection. VGS’s solution is to mediate — and anonymize — transactions, authorizations, and authentications so that our personal information is not stored and transmitted along the daisy chain of hospitals, retailers, online stores, and other points-of-sale, including all their vendors and vendors’ vendors." (https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2018/09/25/euro...)

We are accepting applications for individuals who are interested in reverse engineering, cryptography, data security, privacy, application security, and/or working on making best practices accessible to developers everywhere. We have a very ambitious roadmap, well funded, and growing at a very fast pace.

When applying, please let us know why you think you'd make a great candidate. You can find open jobs here: https://jobs.lever.co/vgs. If you do not see a role that you're interested in, but are interested in learning more, please apply anyway!

Neemo | iOS, Android, Ui/Ux & Design | Remote (or Waterloo, ON or Taipei) | Full Time / Technical Founders
Social sucks these days. Data driven utilities that are faceless and don’t care about their users. Let’s change that. Let’s make social integrate with real life, with space and time. Let’s make social ephemeral and lets make real connections.

Neemo plans to be the first popup social utility on the web. Think of it as a group whataapp chat centered around time and space. Wanna connect with everyone at the Golden State/Lakers game? Neemo makes it easy. Its like a flash mob… just there when you’re there for something fun, adding a layer for group chat, photo, video and meme sharing. Make new friends centered around where you are, now.

We've got a kickass name, people who helped found one of the fastest and most popular social networks in Asia (Plurk) and a beautiful vision. We just need other self starters who believe and want to help build the next generation of social utilities.

Email us with a resume or why you might be a good fit!

We're on a mission to increase employee’s private company ownership by helping them exercise their options - a complex and opaque process that typically comes with a lot of anxiety and unanswered questions. Our tools help you take control of your stock options and maximize their potential.

For example: one of the most complicated things for employees is figuring out how much taxes they need to pay when exercising their Incentive Stock Options or Non-qualified Stock Options. Our recently launched tax planning tool does just that: https://www.secfi.com/option-tax-planning/

Things we are building next: multiyear tax forecast analysis, recommendation engine based on various sources and fantastic UX and UI.

Coveo | SOLUTION DEVELOPER - IMPLEMENTATION | Montreal & Quebec City, Canada | Full-time, ONSITE
As a solution developer, you will implement search-based applications that change the digital experience for our customers and their customers. Coveo has game-changing features out-of-the-box, but you will need great business acumen and technical skills to configure it perfectly to our customers' environment. Indexing, in the cloud, millions of documents in hundreds of different systems and delivering search results that are relevant to the user’s situation in less than a second brings its own particular challenges.

Profile:

* You have very strong coding skills that you developed either during your degree in computer science or with years of experience in the business. (A mix of both is ideal!)

* You are better than most with JS, Python, C# and ASP.NET. You are also comfortable working on Windows AND Linux.

* You can suit up one day and wear a Star Wars t-shirt the next…

* You have a thing for business… You love creating value and improving performance.

While we offer all the perks people come to expect of a job (great new offices, top of the line equipment, competitive salaries and insurance, unlimited cappucinos and snacks, nerf gun battles), we think the best part about working with us is simply being excited about going to work every day. On a day to day basis you'll continually face interesting challenges, have great autonomy and you'll be able to bring your ideas to the table knowing that your team genuinely wants to hear them.

Interview Process: phone screen - interview - tech test - offer.

King & Union | Python/Back-end developer | Washington, DC | ONSITE FULL-TIME
The point: We are an information security/threat intelligence company. Our goal is to make the threat intelligence process run more smoothly and help organizations share threat data better. Our web app pulls threat information (both our own and via external APIs) into a graph and enables real-time collaboration and sharing of the information on the graph. (If you're aware of the tools, think of combining Google Docs with a graph editor like Maltego and mix in some process automation.)

What we're looking for: a mid/advanced back-end developer comfortable with Python & Django. The back-end of our application is built in Python with Django/Django Channels. Ideally, the person for this role would also understand command line work (we're still small, we all do a bit of everything). There would also be some design work as we roll out new features to the site and migrate data graph db in the near future.

Perks of the job: early round shares, competitive salary, 401k, & healthcare benefits. Also, we work from home a lot and our focus is on getting the work done, not on face time.

A bit about us: We are a pre-A-round startup. We have a working product and paying customers, so we're in a good spot financially. We are based in Alexandria, VA but as mentioned above, working from home is common. We tend to meet up in Alexandria once a week.

We encourage all who are interested to contact us. You can reach me at: aaron@kingandunion.com

There are a number of positions listed on our website but one the one that I want to highlight isn't posted yet -- we're tentatively calling it "Robotics Software Engineer". We're looking for an engineer with experience developing and testing motion planning and simulation of autonomous robots (ideally autonomous vehicles) to help build out a system that can be used as a reference implementation to help guide for integration of our technology into customer systems.

We're still pulling together the job description, so I can't link to a posting yet but please reach out if you think it sounds like a good fit for your background!

We’re building a community of creative young people working on interesting projects around the globe. We use software and ML to find people that lack opportunity but have great talent and ambition. We give them small grants to support their work and try to use various gamification techniques to keep them motivated on their project. Our goal is to be counterfactually significant in the creation of the next Albert Einstein, Marie Curie or Elon Musk.

In the short term our technical challenges are equal parts computer science and human psychology. How do you build a product that can identify greatness? How do you then motivate people to become the best version of themselves? If you were building the Harvard campus, but entirely online, could you make it work?

It requires great intuition and solid engineering. We work in Python, Ruby and Javascript.

Contract Simply (S17) | Junior and Senior Full-stack Software Engineers | Austin, TX | ONSITE | https://contractsimply.com
Contract Simply (https://contractsimply.com) is looking for full-stack engineers in Austin (junior and senior).

ABOUT US

Contract Simply is building the first A.I., machine learning platform for the $900B US construction lending market. We help banks manage their large and complex construction loan portfolio using intelligent automation and integrated payments. Unlike a typical loan, a construction loan isn’t a single payment. Instead, it’s broken up into monthly payments called draws. That monthly draw process is complicated, with many stakeholders and hundreds or thousands of documents. Currently, all of this is managed with excel spreadsheets, PDFs, emails, and paper checks.

Our software helps lenders, developers, and other stakeholders produce and process this documentation automatically, leading to fewer errors, faster payments, and more profitable loans.

We’re currently small (10 employees), YC-backed, and are already working with several of the largest lenders in the industry. You’d be working directly with the founders in a company that values being purposeful, efficient, authentic, transparent, curious, and agile.

STACK

Experience in one/all of the following is appreciated, but we believe tool-specific knowledge is considerably less important than the fundamentals:

Elixir, Phoenix, GraphQL, React, Apollo, Python, sklearn, Kubernetes, Docker, and more!

GET IN TOUCH

Junior Devs (1-3 years of experience): https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/contractsimplycom/vi...

DefenseStorm | Senior Software Engineer, Junior Software Engineer | Full-Time | ONSITE | Seattle | https://www.defensestorm.com/ At DefenseStorm, we help detect and stop cyberattacks for small and mid-size community banks and credit unions.
Networks make a lot of logs - some of them are very important but there is huge volume of noise. We ingest all of our customers’ network logs, and allow customers to quickly search through them, set alerts, investigate threats, and generate reports. Our product makes it easy to track and demonstrate compliance with financial cybersecurity regulations and guidelines - which has shortened many of our customers’ arduous ~3 month audit preparations to just a couple weeks. Our customers are very happy, which makes work more fun.

I actually got hired here through an HN Who’s Hiring post about 3 years ago!

We are looking for Junior and Senior Software Engineers. Our stack is primarily Java, Elasticsearch, AWS, Angular, Typescript. Dev-ops and cybersecurity experience are ideal, but not required. We’re big on code review - we use phabricator. We have great monitoring and a nice CI system so deployment is mostly painless while still being safe. Really good engineering culture: you will learn and become a better programmer by working with this team - I have.

Dog friendly office! Every Tuesday we do a ‘Topic Sync’ to share knowledge on technical topics for an hour - nice way to continue learning. Keg, espresso machine, wall of snacks. Free lunches on Wednesday. It’s a fun place to work.

Transloadit | Technical writer | Part-time | Remote | https://transloadit.com/jobs/
Hi, founder at Transloadit here. We just posted a vacancy today. To summarize:

Our company is looking for a developer who enjoys technical writing to provide content around our projects in the form of blog posts, documentation, tutorials and walkthroughs. In essence, you’ll be paid to hang out in our various Slack channels and play around with our tech:

* a commercial API for uploading & encoding: https://transloadit.com

* open SDKs for all major programming languages: https://github.com/transloadit

* an open protocol for resumable file uploads: https://tus.io

* the next open source file uploader for webbrowsers: https://uppy.io

While doing so, you’ll be taking notes on any issues you encounter (which we’ll use to improve our products) or anything you think might be fun or interesting to write about. You’ll also be asked to write rough blog posts about new features we are working on. Your writing doesn’t need to be flawless from the get-go, since you will be working closely with our in-house editor/writer who can turn raw technical content into well-polished posts.

We’re looking for someone who is proficient in English and has experience with GitHub, Markdown and Node.js.

We're hoping to publish around two substantial posts each month, along with minor updates and tweaks to our existing docs and demos. The job is for 20 to 32 hours a month, paying $25/h. You can work whenever you see fit, but we do require a 2-hour overlap with our office hours (07:00-15:00 UTC) during which you are comfortable working for us. That way, we won't have to rely purely on async communication.

We think this is a great opportunity for tech students and freelancers with some spare time! If this sounds interesting to you, please check out the full vacancy here: https://transloadit.com/jobs/2018-10-technical-writer/ and drop me a line at kvz@transloadit.com.

Our team is building a suite of machine learning tools to help solve problems in the life science space. This includes the classification of researchers and physicians to their scholarly research, simulating how effective drug compounds will be, and much more.

We're growing fast in a field that is also growing fast, so we're looking for people who want to grow fast too. We think an environment that is supportive, collaborative, and sophisticated is the key to making this happen.

Our data scientists do these kinds of things:

Deploy machine learning techniques against a set of collected and cleaned data. We’ve separated the data engineering and data science roles at H1 because we want our data scientists to spend their time analyzing data, not cleaning it.

Work within a Spark/Scala/Python environment from notebooks through mature pipelines. Our data scientists are able to implement algorithms in code that runs at scale.

Tune and tweak common algorithms for the right result. Our data scientists are able to tell us how the shape of the data influences the performance of the algorithm, and what the trade-offs are between using one algorithm over another.

Find an academic paper which explains a new machine learning concept, and implement it. This involves not only coding the application, but testing against real-world data and potentially making improvements.

All candidates must have a very thorough understanding of linear algebra and statistics. This means understanding various fundamental matrix decompositions and their effects, various statistical distributions and their applications.

If creating foundational infrastructure in data science using the latest tools and techniques sounds appealing, we'd love to start a conversation. Email me: josh.geisler(at)h1insights.com

United Income | FinTech Startup | Full Stack Engineer - Python (and Javascript) background | Onsite in Washington, DC | Full Time
We’re hiring! United Income is a fintech startup looking to add engineering talent to our team. Email us at engineering@unitedincome.com if this describes you.

• Do you care about delivering quality product to your users?

• Is providing maintainable, tested code to your fellow engineers (and future self) important to you?

• Do you have a deep understanding of Javascript and/or Python? Are you interested in the movement to a serverless infrastructure?

• When you encounter a problem that isn't neatly packaged and fully defined, are you passionate about digging into it and refining a solution?

If you can answer yes to these questions, you'll find working here exciting and engaging.

At United Income, we value collaboration. We encourage one another to build phenomenal things, and individually we’re all passionate about doing our best work. You'll be responsible for solving some hard problems in consumer finance. As you tackle these problems head on, you'll work with others across the company to make sure you have all the information you need.

Some of our engineering roles involve cool mathematical modeling. If you can engineer and you also have fun thinking about math, we have some opportunities for you that can be difficult to find in standard engineering jobs. We are committed to equal opportunity and diverse hiring. Even more important than hiring is supporting our diverse team, and we are dedicated to equitable pay and transparency.

As you know, this industry moves FAST. If you have 10 years of Node.js experience...well we think you’re lying ;) We don't expect you to be familiar with our entire tech stack (buzzwords: Javascript/Python/React/AWS/CI/CD/Git). What’s important is your willingness and ability to learn. We want to see your curiosity and passion for what’s out there.

We are a small team of software engineers, computational biologists, clinicians, and geneticists building cutting-edge tools and methods for interpreting the largest public dataset of human genetic variation ever assembled: currently ~200,000 individual human genomes/exomes and approaching 1 million over the next few years. We aim to determine how genetic variation alters our proteins, biochemical pathways, cells, tissues, physiology, and traits/susceptibility to disease.

Position 1: Work with a team of genome analysts to develop software for solving real genetic disease cases. You should be excited about the engineering challenges associated with loading, searching, deploying, and visualizing huge genomic datasets stored in the cloud. Your work will directly help thousands of kids/families find the root causes of rare genetic disease.

Position 2: Are you interested in understanding how human traits are associated with genes? This role involves building an interface for scientists to browse through thousands of human phenotypes and explore regions of the genome that are associated with these phenotypes/traits. We are looking for a brilliant data visualization engineer that can synthesize multiple datasets and craft performant, beautiful, and useful web applications.

Technologies we use: React, Redux, Python, Docker, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, Google Cloud. We are looking for friendly people with demonstrated experience in web tech, an eye for design, and genuine interest in learning new things. We are supportive of candidates interested in transitioning to graduate school. Your work will be 100% open source and highly visible in the genomics community. You will shape the way scientists interpret human genetic variation.

Our version of GraphQL executes all queries as "live" by default. This means you do not need to worry about data changes when designing a feature. If you want to learn more, we're having a Meetup in NYC on the 23rd. RSVP here https://www.meetup.com/typescript-react/events/254691034/

QuotaPath | Frontend, Backend or Full-stack Engineer | Philadelphia, PA or Austin, TX | Full-Time | On-Site | https://www.quotapath.com/careers/
Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, sales professionals are forced to use unfriendly accounting software from the web 1.0 era, or worse, to pass around Excel spreadsheets, without the ability to verify the calculations or understand how they work.

At QuotaPath, we're solving this problem in a new way. We're creating a platform that's built for salespeople, not accountants. This means our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B ("B2BC"). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we're working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.

We're looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development as a product and as a company. If you're interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We're well-funded, but we're still only 6 people: 2 engineers, 1 UX and 3 others in product and executive team. I'm one of those 2 engineers, and I'm also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!

Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we're more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we'll hear you. Like most startups, we're built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.

Our entire production is in AWS. In fact, Smarkets was the first gambling operator under the Maltese regulator to get permission to run everything in the cloud. We push the envelope where needed and educate auditors when necessary.

Broad array of technologies: JVM languages (java, clojure, groovy), Postgres, docker + kubernetes, telecom networking protocols, message queues.

In brief, the technical challenge of Expeto is to provide an API to manage 4G networks for non-experts.

Smart Host | Berlin, Germany | Senior Backend Developer (Java) | Full-time | Visa | Onsite | https://www.smart-host.com/
Smart Host is giving independent hotels the digital marketing tools that help them stay relevant in the age of booking.com and Airbnb. Our CRM suite consists of 3 modules: Guests: giving the hotels insights about their in-house guests in order to tailor services to their needs. Campaigns: to send only relevant information to their previous guests and turn them into returning customers. Offers: to craft custom offers for potential guests who are requesting a stay. All our modules are using advanced statistical analysis hidden in the background to synthesize actionable information and give clear advice to our customers on how to treat and market to their guests while avoiding to spam them with irrelevant information.

We are handling customer data with all the care it deserves and are, of course, fully compliant with GDPR. We do not mine from any external data sources and instead solely rely on data the hotels are gathering during a guests stay as well as online surveys conducted directly with the guests. This leaves us with generally very high quality of data.

Smart Host is a two year old, VC funded startup that is run by two experienced entrepreneurs who each have successfully founded two companies previously. All the members of the technical team are highly experienced and are looking for support from other experienced and motivated individuals.

We are hiring a Senior Backend Engineer (Java/Spring Boot, Python), Salary: 65k - 85k.

We're steadily growing our software team of 11 engineers (including myself), 4 QA engineers, and 1 designer to help develop and release three novel products this year.

We're relatively young for a biotech company (founded in 2012), but scientists are already really excited about our technology. This is evidenced by the company making $71 million in revenue in 2017, double our revenue the previous year. We're working hard to continue the trend this year. Last month we announced that we're building out a new office space that's quadruple our current square footage. We're excited to move into this new space next summer. [1]

You can find out more about our massively parallel pipelines as well as our visualization software at https://support.10xgenomics.com/. We manage our pipelines with Go, develop analysis code using Rust and the NumPy/SciPy stack, and drive our front-end applications with React/Redux. No previous biological experience is required, but if you're interested there are an abundance of opportunities to learn! You'll work with a team who are alums of YC, Google, Facebook, 23andMe, MIT, Harvard, Caltech, and more.

We're currently hiring for all types of software roles including full stack, front end, back end, infrastructure, UI, and QA engineers. You can see the full listing at our careers page: https://www.10xgenomics.com/careers/.

Stealth, bootstrapped, close to launch.

We're looking for two people to help get us to launch a little faster:

1. A front-end developer with design experience (HTML + CSS, Bootstrap 4) to help us polish the design for the public-facing parts of the site

I’ve worked with front-end designer-developers in the past and it’s always been great. The vast majority of the design work for the project has been done by a visual designer and implemented by a front-end developer. Having a single designer-developer instead of both a designer and developer for the final design pass (polish, consistency, and fine tuning) would really speed things along. Design friendly team.

Email: Mike at jobs+design(at)edition(dot)io if you're interested.

2. Angular 6 and/or React developer to help us finish our dashboard. Experience with Draft.js and working with Django would be great, but not requirements.

Email: Mike at jobs+angular(at)edition(dot)io if you're interested.

Who we’re looking for someone who’s:

* Reliable.

* A strong finisher. That last 10% is always a steep climb. (Who’s hyped for progressive image loading?)

Who am I:

* Hi, I’m Mike. (Python/Django developer for 11 years)

* Angular + TypeScript for fun in my spare time. Made a massively multiplayer adaptation of the board game Codenames recently:

As an ideal candidate, you have 5+ years of relevant experience, including working at a fast-growing startup.

You have a passion for writing correct, clear, maintainable, and well-tested code, and have experience and interest in mentoring junior developers.

You should also be an expert in:

* creating iOS applications in Swift

* diagnosing and fixing bugs and performance issues

* ingesting and working with REST APIs.

* testing using Quick.

If you are applying as a full-stack developer, you should also be expert in:

* using Laravel or a similar MVC web framework such as Spring, Ruby on Rails, Django, or Express.

* relational databases, including designing schema, writing queries, and diagnosing performance issues.

* Redis and ElasticSearch

* productionizing, orchestrating, and autoscaling server infrastructure on AWS.

Everyone gets trained as a professional taster.
Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products and optimize their existing brands by predicting the optimal flavor, aroma and texture for target consumer cohorts.

Our Services

_Innovation Management_: New product development, flavor profile optimization, & portfolio management (multi-product optimization).

_Cognitive Marketing_: Product description optimization to prime consumers to like a product more by purposely engineering a perception bias.

_Deep Market Insights_: Predictions for emergent market preferences by region and demographic.

The Position(s)

_Engineering_: We're currently looking in two specific areas: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Streaming infrastructure focused engineers capable of integrating the data pipeline and outputs of machine learning models into an easy to use management platform.

_Data Science_: Data science is central to the value and insights we provide for our clients. We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. We are a team of data scientists that understand our clients and turn nebulous business goal into quantitative decision metrics and predictive models to optimize those metrics. The extensive role of data scientists at Analytical Flavor Systems allows us to invest in their education across sensory perception (standard sensory science so they know what we're improving and replacing), tasting experiences (so they appreciate the products we work on and understand how the data is collected), production knowledge, and data science tear-downs (a meeting where the team collaboratively attempts to find and fix problems, try new techniques, and debate the philosophical implications of a model's construction).

Parse.ly | Growth & Data Lead | EST, CST Preferred | Full-Time | Remote | https://parse.ly
What's Parse.ly? A real-time content measurement layer for the entire web.

Parse.ly is trusted by over 400 enterprises, used by over 3,000 high-traffic websites, and has tens of thousands of active user seats. We are an established, but quickly-growing, company with a 30+ person product + engineering + design team, sitting inside a 70+ person company. We have millions of dollars in revenue.

We have two products. Parse.ly Analytics (https://parse.ly/analytics) is our flagship product, which measures first-party content engagement and audience attention on sites and apps. Just recently, we launched Parse.ly Currents (https://parse.ly/currents), which showcases aggregate attention trends from over 1 billion monthly internet readers in a novel, privacy-safe way.

The mission of our lean distributed team is described here:

https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission/?utm_campaign=oct201....

We happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. Here's a photograph of mine running two full-screen Parse.ly Analytics dashboards on my monitors:

https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73

As our first Growth & Data Lead, you'll run a small team of designers and developers that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s public website, technical documentation, knowledge base, emails/newsletters, data studies, and blog.

You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to any of these projects, with a goal of growing sign-ups (and customers) for these products. From a technical standpoint, you'll be able to use modern web development tools atop a simple and agile JavaScript and Python stack, and to work with designers/developers comfortable with that stack. But you'll also use analytics tools like Google Analytics, MixPanel and yes, even, Parse.ly itself, to understand engagement of our visitors, and to position us for more growth in new channels like organic search, social sharing, data-driven press, and free (self-service) data products.

If you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, and you want to take a B2B software company to the next level, this job is for you. To do this, you'll have designers and web developers as collaborators, and be able to leverage data-oriented growth marketing strategies, such as launching public products built with Parse.ly's data, or layering growth features into our existing products.

To be a fit for this role, you are the kind of person who’d enjoy the books "Hacking Growth", "Traction", and "High Growth Handbook". If you are a former startup founder seeking to relocate to an established startup, but want to continue the path of deploying lean growth techniques, this role may be especially suited for you.

Apply at work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/projects you think may be relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile. Make sure to mention HN and the "Growth & Data Lead" role. Also, please list your timezone, working hours, and location. Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US/Eastern timezone, due to the timezone makeup of this team.

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. Forbes listed us as #4 on the Cloud 100 [1] and Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security." [2]

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3]

--

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, and self-directed PTO ("unlimited vacation" - most folks take 4~5 weeks). The Great Place to Work survey gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, price, communication, and more. [4]

I can't name salary ranges, but my total comp as a remote Senior Software Engineer is about $320k ($165k base, ~$100k bonus, and ~$55k stock).

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.

On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

TrueCar | Santa Monica, CA | ONSITE or REMOTE | Full-Time | https://truecar.com
TrueCar is hiring engineers to help us improve the car buying experience. We're on the verge of finishing up our replatforming initiative, and we're getting ready to re-accelerate our product development and further improve our infrastructure.

A good chunk of our engineering team, including leadership, came from CarWoo (YC S08). We value moving fast, structuring things so that we can keep moving fast, and not being afraid to do hard things. (This is sounds so obvious on HN, but it can be a hard sell sometimes when you're in the automotive industry.)

The core development frameworks we use are Rails and React. Our data stores include PostgreSQL, Redshift, Elasticsearch, and HBase. For infrastructure management, we use Terraform and Ansible. All of this runs on AWS.

Our core consumer- and dealer-facing application is a Rails application with a React frontend, backed by PostgreSQL and Redis. It's an intentionally monolithic Rails API. We also have other Rails apps for data curation, infrastructure management, and data movement to facilitate a lot of the workflows around data that add value and speed up our development.

We've also built internal tooling whenever it helps us move faster or drastically reduce the amount of manual work for our teammates. One of our tools, Spacepods, is a Rails app that churns out identical, isolated development environments (complete with data sets) so there's a mini-TrueCar that each engineer can start developing against immediately, without having to worry about breaking a shared integration environment that other developers depend on. Spacepods also powers our deployments and coordinates our CI/CD pipeline.

Openings:

- Senior Rails Engineer. You've run Rails at scale and know Ruby and Rails really, really well. "Convention over configuration" is always nice to get started, but you've had to roll up your sleeves and configure things, ranging from Ruby VM internals to caching layers to connection pooling. You'd be working on the Rails app that powers our consumer-facing experience.

- Senior Rails Engineer (Platform). You've run Rails at scale, maybe in a smaller company, and have thought to yourself at some point, "If only we had the resources to build developer tools to make our processes better and more repeatable." You'll probably have a lot of fun in this role if you like working on the tooling that gets used by other engineers and get a kick out of enabling others to be 10x/100x more productive.

- Site Reliability Engineer. You know Linux systems, networking, and/or AWS really well. Each team member has a slightly different emphasis but everyone on the team has in common is that we value reliability, observability, and performance.

- Site Reliability Engineer (Data). Measure, monitor, and understand YARN/HDFS/HBase performance in production. Design/architect deployment and verification procedures for data pipelines. One of the overarching and continuing challenges here is to take everything great that everyone loves about DevOps and CI/CD, and apply it to our data pipelines. Inherent statefulness and the size of the data make this a challenge.

- Data Warehouse Engineer. Write ETL to efficiently bring in data from various data sources, enrich it, and make it available to everyone in the company so our decisions are backed by good data. We make use of Postgres and Redshift.

Even if you're not sure you fit in any one of the above, please reach out if any of this sounds interesting to you. (If you read all the way down here, it's a good sign that we should talk!) At the end of the day, we're just looking for smart, determined, pragmatic people who love building things and solving problems. We care less about hitting all the bullet points in a job description.

Still interested, or just want to talk? Reach out to me at jgo AT truecar.com

Royal Academy of Sciences | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Software Engineer | Full-time, onsite only, Visa | $40K – $60K Build open source software that slowly but surely links all historical data in Europe together
We're a team of engineers at the Royal Academy of Sciences in the Netherlands. We build (or implement) Open Source SaaS software that allows users to work their data[1][2]. We're looking for front-end / back-end engineers (we prefer people who like a little bit of both) to add features for exposing the data (search, visualisation) and for working with the data (distributes storage, reasoning/inferring knowledge).

Examples of problems we tackle:

- Given that you have about a million mentions of names in notarial archives of the 17th century, can you make an educated guess at which of those mentions are about the same person? Please note: spelling was optional back then. Birthdates were approximations as well.

- Given that you have two scanned pieces of parchment with handwritten text. Can you detect if they were written by the same author? Can you detect what constitutes the "main" writing and what are the reader's notes?

- Can you extract all mentions of places, people and events from a text. Can you do it with a lexicon that changes over time?

- Given a 12km archive of decisions of a legislative body. Can you use network analysis to find clicques based on voting patterns?

As you can see most of these problems are not "novel" per sé, but they are often made a tad more difficult by the historical aspect. And they sure are fun :)

We provide an environment where people enjoy freedom of work, where our clients understand the uncertainty of experimentation (they're researchers after all) and where all code is published under an open-source license.

We're using python and java (yes, voluntarily), react (I know, sooo 2016) and we're hosting on kubernetes. We don't really care if you've used these exact technologies before, but we do care if you have built up greenfield applications as well as to have worked on applications that have been in development for a few years.

Contract benefits: other then what you get in any Dutch company (which is pretty good, especially for US standards) we provide you with a 38 hour workweek and 30 paid holidays (outside of the national holidays such as christmas)

Interview process: you send us some examples of real applications you wrote -> phone interview -> at a later date a technical challenge (in person or screenshare) -> final interview (finalizing the agreement)

Drop me a line at jauco.noordzij . di.huc.knaw.nl!

NoRedInk | Director of Engineering, Full-Stack Engineers, Site Reliability Engineers, and Engineering Managers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

For our Director of Engineering role, we're seeking an experienced engineering leader who’s operated and scaled a high-performing team, cares about tackling complex technical challenges, and maintains a high bar for talent and engineering practices.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Jump.Work | Frontender, Backender, Data Engineer | Amsterdam or London | ONSITE (we provide VISA SPONSORSHIP) | FULL-TIME
Hate recruiters? Eager to disrupt the agency industry? Or just passionate about using real data to understand human behaviour, and help people with their careers?

Jump.Work is a Talent Platform in the business services space that applies innovative Behavioural Data Science and Machine Learning to reinvent the way professionals & companies discover and choose each other.

TL;DR

You can either apply directly (those links say either Amsterdam or London, but we're cool with whichever of these locations you prefer):

- Frontender: https://workstaf.breezy.hr/p/7f5f3ec9623301-senior-front-end...

or shoot me an email (I'm the CTO): rodrigo@jump.work

The Long(er) Read

We all know companies that have transformed industries (e.g., Google, Netflix, Spotify) by analysing information about you and giving you personalised suggestions that seem to know you better then even yourself – but where is the equivalent for jobs? Netflix’s recommendations are not based on “back of the box” blurbs - instead, they extract traits from movies and match them to your taste, based on your interactions. So why are we still evaluating people based on their “blurbs,” i.e. their CVs?

We use a combination of unique behavioural data, machine learning, and of course efficient product development, to go beyond the CV and find patterns that humans would otherwise not detect (at least not at scale).

Our longer-term goal is to be not only a preferred destination for transactional hiring, but a compelling, intuitive guide to planning and executing your career goals.

We have just closed a successful fundraising round and are expanding our team! This is a super exciting time to join, as it’s still early enough that you'll help us shape the foundations of the platform and tackle some very interesting problems, yet we’ve already got enough usage, traction and data that you'll have a real, immediate effect on people's lives.

We are very serious about finding the right mix of talent, passion and ownership that meets our values, and is necessary for an ambitious early-stage startup. As we grow, the expectation is that you will too. All doors are open, from diving deeper into a technical speciality, to moving sideways into another area, to mentorship and leadership roles - in the end, it's down to you, your goals and your performance.

If you want to be a part of a big, ambitious story, let's chat!

That’s why we’re building a web-based school scheduling platform, that allows administrators to put master schedules and daily calendars into a single cloud-based system. We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools.

We have a diverse team, we're well funded, we have experienced leadership, and I could go on. The interview process is, in my opinion, very fair.

--------------------------------------------------

Sr. Product Designer

What you'll do:

+ You’ll think and design holistically to create a cohesive and coherent product experience that delivers high value to school leaders

+ You’ll tackle a complex puzzle--master scheduling-- and provide users with an intuitive tool and process, simplifying a complicated workflow

+ You'll create high-level user stories, UX flows, wireframes, prototypes, design mockups, specs, and production assets

+ You’ll collaborate with the internal schools and engineering teams, and with customers

+ You’ll provide actionable feedback gracefully and without ego, and won't hesitate to seek guidance yourself

Qualifications:

+ Impact focused: You’re a strategic thinker able to tackle complex user problems, addressing fundamental user needs and delivering impact

+ Project management: You've designed, coordinated, and shipped intuitive user experiences from conception to execution.

+ Ability to think big and small: You’re comfortable envisioning versions of features many years in the future and working on a single feature’s first iteration

+ Design depth: Experience designing data-heavy visualizations, recommendation UX and/or enterprise software is a big plus.

+ Natural leadership: You enjoy taking initiative and owning projects, big and small. The details matter and you're committed to getting it done right.

I applied by emailing Matt here in the past and got an email from a hiring manager asking to set up an initial phone call. He then flaked on the scheduled phone call, did not respond to emails asking about rescheduling, and I got a form letter rejection 3 weeks later. Would not recommend this process.

Eventplicity | Fullstack, Frontend, Backend Engineer | Gainesville, FL | REMOTE (anywhere) | Full-time | http://www.eventplicity.com
We are seeking both a Senior Backend Engineer and a Senior FrontEnd Engineer. (Fullstack developers also welcome.)

About Eventplicity Eventplicity provides planning and logistics software that helps restaurants book private parties and special events. We're a startup with an exciting growth trajectory. This isn't restaurant reservations. We book private events that involve the planning and execution of many intricate details. We provide a modern web application that tackles the surprising number of complexities involved in planning private parties from start to finish. Every venue is different, every event is different, and every booking is different. Join our team and help us build the right set of abstractions and the modern interface that will wrangle these complexities into a smooth, easy-to-understand online booking experience.

Our Stack:

Front-End: Modern Javascript stack (ES 2015+ syntax, babel, webpack, jest, React, Redux, Socket.io, Bootstrap)

Back-End: Python, Flask, Small amount of Node.js & Go, Redis, PostgreSQL

DevOps: AWS, Docker, CircleCI, Git / Github

Development Culture

* We greatly value high quality code and strong technical acumen.

* Since we're a startup, we understand there are tradeoffs and there will be technical debt. We can't make everything perfect. While we greatly value high quality code, we know it's equally important to move fast and learn from our users in order to succeed.

* We prefer stable technologies, but we also want to use modern tools.

* We do not make artificial deadlines. We work hard to be productive, but it's never a push for an arbitrary date.

* There is no bureaucracy (our software team is small).

Got questions? Sounds interesting? Feel free to contact us at devjobs@eventplicity.com
