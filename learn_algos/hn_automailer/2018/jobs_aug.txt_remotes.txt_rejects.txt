Snapcraft (https://snapcraft.io) | Senior Software Engineer | REMOTE | Full time
The Snapcraft team at Canonical (Ubuntu) are trying to make it easy to deliver app updates to all Linux-based cloud, IoT, and desktop systems safely (confinement, rollbacks) and automatically.

We're motivated by making developers' lives easier. We want to see people spend time on what makes their app unique and interesting, not on packaging. We also understand that developers currently face an impossible choice between few updates to lower the risk of breakage and frequent updates to lower the risk of compromise.

The open position is for a Senior Software Engineer. We want someone with years of war stories building developer tools to help re-architect the core of Snapcraft (https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft). It needs to integrate deep into Python, Node, Ruby, Electron, and others so that releasing your app for tens of millions of Linux users is a natural extension of setup.py or npm run.

The Energotest R&D department team is looking for a senior developer who would be willing to take part in setting new directions in the development of systems for the broader "Industry 4.0". The person will help us change the world of automation systems, face the task of creating tools for engineers and firmware for devices manufactured by Energotest. Working together in the R&D department, we are happy to share our knowledge, but the ability to independently solve problems and look for information will be a desirable skill. If you have skills that do not meet all of the following requirements, but enter other areas of programming and feel that they will help develop our project or make it a unique product, we will gladly talk to you.

Essential skills: GNU/Linux, Git, Bash, C++, Boost, Qt

Nice to have:

* Python (and Boost.Python)

* Experience with embedded Linux (yocto)

* Modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17)

* Functional programming (Haskell)

* Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS)

Extra notes:

* It doesn't harm if you also know MFC, C#, Delphi and Windows in general

* Official language in Energotest is Polish

* Remote work is partially possible (1 day/week)

Truss | Software Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer | San Francisco or REMOTE | https://truss.works
Particularly interested in Ruby/React and Javascript/React at this time.

Truss solves complex technical problems for the private sector and government. We helped rebuild Healthcare.gov after its public failure in 2013. We seek the highest standard both in terms of the technology we build, and the way we run our company. We'd love to chat with you.

We are a software consultancy known for pragmatism, autonomy, expertise, and trust. We build strong relationships with our clients, contractors, and employees and we believe that this is fundamental to doing great work. As a Truss engineer you will facilitate bringing Truss values (https://truss.works/values/) to those truly trying to make a difference in our government, and enable them to understand what their citizens actually need rather than implementing a perceived solution.

Here are some of the things we care about: * Great communication! Including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing * The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy * Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools * Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc. * Experience deploying at least one application that other people use * Have held at least one engineering position post-education * Initiative, curiosity, a bias for action, and a problem-solving attitude

We expect all Truss engineers to consistently develop new skills, and cross-train into new disciplines outside of their current areas of expertise.

numo | Mobile Software Engineer (Flutter) | Pittsburgh, PA | Full-time | REMOTE possible but ONSITE preferred
http://jobs.numo.com/apply/fLLTgs8Xzu/Mobile-Software-Engine...

At numo (https://www.numo.com), we create and incubate new "fintech" companies. We have the good fortune of starting from a clean slate (i.e., no legacy code) and are able to use the latest and greatest frameworks and tools.

We are actively working on our first product, a banking app for the freelance/gig economy workforce. We've chosen to use Flutter as our mobile framework and are ideally looking for someone with actual Flutter experience. Given it is a new framework, we are of course willing to talk to folks with real world mobile experience on iOS and/or Android (hopefully both).

Our backend is Scala/Akka running at AWS.

Our strong preference is to have an on-site developer, but we are willing to contemplate remote arrangements for exceptional candidates. In this case, travel to our Pittsburgh headquarters would be required (and frequent in the beginning).

If interested, please apply using link above - I review the applications personally. Please note in the cover letter you saw this in Hacker News.

NoRedInk | Back-End, Front-End, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE | $300k+ total comp
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. For networks with 20k+ computers, it's the best option by a long shot, and it scales to over a million endpoints without breaking a sweat.

Lt. Gen. Bill Bender, the recently-retired CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [1]

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I'll also called out a few positions below.

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, and self directed/unlimited vacation (most folks take 4~5 weeks).

I can't name salary ranges, but my total comp as a remote Senior Software Engineer is about $320k ($165k base, ~$100k bonus, and ~$55k stock).

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.



On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

BookMyScan | https://bookmyscan.co.uk | Cambridge / London, UK | REMOTE (Europe) | Full-time | Python/Django/PostgreSQL | Senior Full Stack Developer | £40-£50k
I am the CTO at BookMyScan, and we develop online booking systems for diagnostic scans. We have a number of exciting opportunities, and therefore need to expand the development team.

I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.

Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day. I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.

Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.

We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.

Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.
