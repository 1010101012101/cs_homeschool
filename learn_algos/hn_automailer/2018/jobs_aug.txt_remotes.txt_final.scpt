I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with javascript, web and noticed them in the post.
I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM

I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with web, ethereum, react, angular and noticed them in the post.
I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM

I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with backend, node, javascript, go, mobile, python, aws, elk and noticed them in the post.
Here's my resume: <a href='http://kaustavha.github.io/kaustav-haldar-resume/'>bit.ly/khaldarcv</a>

          Github: <a href='https://github.com/kaustavha'>kaustavha</a> 

Please reach out if you think I'd be a good fit for anything you're looking for. 
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Thanks, 
Kaustav Haldar
