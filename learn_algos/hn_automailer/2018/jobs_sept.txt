People have come to expect intuitive, fast, and beautiful software in their personal lives yet deal with old, slow, and clunky software in their business lives. We are changing that.

Our favorite tools include Node, C#, Angular, Kendo, and React. If you have at least 2 years of professional experience building all parts of modern webapps, value autonomy over routine, and are interested in helping us develop the next generation of software for small and medium sized businesses, we’d love to hear from you.

We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.

All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office. All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.

SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE

Notes

The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 4 months ago I moved to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. We’ve hired 3 remote developers so far and it’s been a great experience!

SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.

Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).

Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.

Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours. We are a registered employer in South Africa and Singapore, so it would be hassle-free if you're based in those countries. If not, and if you've never done remote work for a foreign company before, please be sure to find out how to legally do this in your particular country (it may involve registering as self-employed, for example).

Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put "Hacker News" somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.

FULL STACK PROGRAMMER / FRONTEND PROGRAMMER:

We're looking for an experienced programmer - the kind that could make it to "software architect" at a boring bigco but prefers to get their hands dirty. Our stack is made of TypeScript, React, Elixir, PostgreSQL and a little bit of Node.

JUNIOR PROGRAMMER WHO CAN WRITE:

We're looking for someone who's currently better at writing than at coding but is looking to flip that. We can give you an opportunity to deeply learn tens of technologies in aa very brief time all while producing useful community content (tutorials, code examples, SDKs, etc) for our (potential) customers.

ABOUT YOU

Our team is small and highly proactive, and we expect the same from you. If you need to be told what to do all the time, don't apply. If you want to be the smartest person in a (chat) room full of interns, don't apply. If you want to move fast with an experienced team, get in touch.

Binary Mint | San Francisco, REMOTE/ONSITE

Applied
Notes
⃠
Here at Binary Mint, we fundamentally believe in the value of blockchains, which enable the creation of “decentralized applications,” or DApps. DApps are trustless, transparent, interoperable, and unstoppable, and thus have the potential to empower users in unprecedented ways.

But just like how web 2.0 did not take off until it started seeing usage outside of the military and academia, blockchains are not going to take off until DApps are being used by the average consumers. And yet, it’s the unfortunate reality today that DApps have very little usage outside of finance. The reason is that it’s currently extremely difficult to create DApps that can handle a large number of users efficiently, due to technical limitations with existing blockchains and the lack of good tooling for building DApps.

Binary Mint is all about creating technologies that will make consumer DApps a reality. Our first product is the Tenfold Protocol (https://www.tenfoldprotocol.io/), a practical and versatile platform on which developers can easily build DApps that scale.

Binary Mint is an early-stage startup. As such, you can expect to be wearing many hats, becoming a leader in the company, and making a large impact. We are looking for people who are responsible, driven, and great at what they do. We are a distributed team with a base in San Francisco; both local and remote hires are very welcome.

We push the edge of innovation with regard to blockchain scalability, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and cryptocurrency UX.

If you’re interested in one of the positions below, please send a brief description of your relevant experience and resume/github to jobs@lightning.engineering. And if you know someone who might be a good fit, we'd very much appreciate any referrals.

{Crypto Protocol Engineer}:

Experienced systems software engineer versed in applied cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems, open source software, and cryptocurrency protocols to design and implement core protocol and algorithmic components of the Lightning Network. Solid programming skills, experience with Go, C, or C++. Prior contributions to crypto protocols and open source software collaboration preferred.

{Frontend Application Developer}:

Our applications are built on React, React Native, MobX, and Electron, communicating with a Lightning daemon over a binary RPC protocol. Ideal applicants will have experience building and shipping React Native applications and maintaining open source projects.

However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

We don't care about resumes or your previous work experience. We don't care how much security work you've done before.

Nylas – San Francisco, NYC or remote | Site Reliability Engineer | AWS, Ansible, Terraform | Full-time

Notes

The Nylas Cloud APIs makes it an order of magnitude easier for companies to add email, calendar, and contacts integrations to their applications. By being at the core of business communication, scheduling, and contacts, we believe we can shape the future of how people work.

We’re looking for Site Reliability Engineers to join our team to help build and scale the infrastructure our platform runs on and the tools our developers need to get work done. Our SRE team is responsible for the infrastructure layer of our API platform—the base operating system (including security), CI/CD & deployment tools, monitoring and observability tools, and our horizontally sharded data storage layer which stores tens of terabytes of data. Right now, our open-source Python sync engine regularly archives terabytes of data across a massive SQL cluster, and our Flask APIs handle tens of millions of requests a day. We aim to scale that several times over in the next year.

At Nylas, “DevOps” is a part of our engineering culture, not a role we’re looking to fill. Our development team shares the pager with operations and makes their own deploys. We’re always looking for ways in which we can have specialists who delight in really knowing different parts of systems but still avoid being silo’d away.

We keep our code and infrastructure automation in the same repo, and you’ll be empowered to make application changes necessary for scaling and reliability in collaboration with our development team.

Our stack: Python, MySQL, Redis, AWS, Debian About you: - You have 2 - 5 years of production engineering experience

- You are located anywhere in US timezones - we have offices in San Francisco and NYC and this team contains remote members

- You value communication and empathy as much as technical prowess

- You can navigate a Linux command line

- You have experience automating systems using any modern configuration management system (Chef, Ansible, Puppet)

- You have experience running services on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure)

- You can write reliable code in at least one scripting language (Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript etc.), though this won’t be a focus of our interview process

- You’re excited to create a modern, scalable infrastructure and automate away drudgery

Nice to have:

- Experience with monitoring systems, databases, or service orchestration using terraform (but don’t worry, it’s OK to learn this stuff on the job if you don't know it already)

Our team collaboratively wrote about our values, benefits, perks, and published them in our open-source handbook. Read it to learn more about Nylas. You can also find more details at: https://www.keyvalues.com/nylas

If you're interested in applying, please send me an email at karim@nylas.com!
