Render (https://render.com) | San Francisco, CA | Software Engineers | Full-time | Visa | Onsite When deploying applications in production, developers are forced to pick between two extremes: expensive yet simplistic platforms like Heroku, or complicated, do-it-all-yourself services like AWS. By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.
Our goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.

We're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our users. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. Our stack is React, GraphQL, Go, Kubernetes and Postgres, but we don't require prior experience with any of them. We're looking for people with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn.

We're serving live applications in production and building out our founding engineering and design teams in SF. The company is backed by top venture funds and former CTOs of VMware and Dropbox.

I'm the founder and would love to hear from you at anurag@render.com.

CCAT-prime Telescope | Toronto | Developer | Full-time | ONSITE | https://ccatp.ca
We're building a 6-meter diameter telescope on a mountain in Chile's Atacama Desert to learn more about how stars form, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, neutrino masses, and the big bang.

The telescope will be shared by multiple instruments, and our group is building the joint software infrastructure: services for controlling the telescope, moving data around, monitoring, alerting, logging, etc.

Stack is still being decided but likely a mix of Go, Python, Redis, Postgres, etc. The telescope site is remote and hostile -- altitude of 5600m in the driest desert on Earth -- so we're focused on fault-tolerance.

https://utoronto.taleo.net/careersection/10000/jobdetail.ftl...

(It's listed as a one-year position, but we expect it to last at least 3-4 years)

Email jobs@ccatp.ca if you have any questions.

It seems unusual for a nonprofit to be able to offer what appear to be market-rate salaries for technical positions. Wonder how they do it. Couldn't find much info on the site about where, exactly, their funding comes from.
I looked at their 2016 Form 990 (most recent available on Guidestar) and it looks like vast majority of funding is from contributions and grants, and revenue exceeds expenses, so that's a good sign.

Hi, I'm an engineer at Thorn. You're right, it is unusual. It's also a big part of our strategy to attract, and keep, top talent. And that goes for talent across the organization: our fundraising, our marketing, our product managers, and our engineers. We're lucky to have such an amazing team, and a fundraising strategy that attracts brilliant investors and donors alike to fund the technology that we need to move the needle on this issue.

META
May I ask you to change the leading text to something more useful for remote workers?

REMOTE doesn't cover but the most basic possibility and 90 matches on this page make it quite cumbersome to find what suits you.

What about deprecating it and requiring posters to use instead:

REMOTE_WORLD - for telecommuting from anywhere in the world

REMOTE_US - for telecommuting from anywhere in the USA

REMOTE_US_TX - for telecommuting from anywhere in Texas, USA

REMOTE_MINUS_6 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC-6 timezone, standard time

REMOTE_PLUS_1 - for telecommuting from anywhere in the UTC+1 timezone, standard time

Example: In the past, I telecommuted to Boston (US-MA) from Barcelona (ES). That job would have been advertised as "REMOTE_MINUS_5, REMOTE_WORLD". In fact I worked 3pm-11pm in ES (i.e. 9am-5pm in US-MA), which was certainly unusual but quite doable nonetheless.

Photofeeler (https://www.photofeeler.com) | Software Engineers, Marketing Roles | REMOTE or Onsite near Boulder/Denver, CO
Work for big tech, but secretly dream of being an early engineer at a startup where everything you do really matters?

Our job offers unparalleled freedom without bureaucratic nonsense (think: can work remote, work flexible hours, no unnecessary meetings). Plus our users are eager and enthusiastic for everything we ship. As an early employee, you'll take part in the ongoing conversations that inform the direction of the company.

Steady Health | Software Engineers | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | Visa | Onsite
Managing your diabetes well can be the difference between a long, healthy life and heart attack, cardiovascular disease, amputations, and blindness. Today, diabetes care is based on guidelines that are the same for everyone, regardless of motivation, lifestyle and other individual factors.

Steady Health is changing diabetes care by leveraging a new technology and dataset, continuous glucose monitors. These sensors let patients track their levels throughout the day without pricking their fingers with complex equipment. We’re building an entirely new clinic experience that use data analysis to help patients understand how diet, physical activity, and medication is impacting their blood sugar levels.

I’m an experienced founder who previously sold a company to Dropbox. My co-founder is an MD who specializes in internal medicine. I’ve also been diabetic for 18 years so between us we know both the patient, and care side, really well.

We're looking for passionate people with a low ego and a drive to learn. Our first clinic will be in San Francisco and we are currently building out our founding engineering and care teams. The company is backed by top funds and angels including former Dropbox CTO and Head of Data Science at Airbnb.

Come and change an important piece of health care with us, email me at henrik.berggren@gmail.com and read my story https://medium.com/@henrikberggren/the-wearable-that-changed...

Ozora Research | Engineers, Linguists | Berkeley, CA | Part-Time | Onsite | Equity
My company, Ozora Research, is developing a next-generation suite of Natural Language Processing tools centered around sentence parsing. We spend our time thinking deeply about the structure of language and then building statistical models that capture the structure. The requirements are: a good background in mathematics and statistics, and a deep interest in language and linguistics. Programming skill is a huge plus, but not an absolute requirement.

I believe we are poised to make a huge dent in the world of NLP and linguistics. The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank). In my research I've discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. I've spent the last couple of years validating the approach, and now that I'm confident it works, I'm looking to build up a team.

I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won't appeal to everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also. I can also guarantee that you will get a ton of great experience that you would be tough to get at a big company. I want to especially encourage the following types of people to reach out:

- Recent grads in technical fields who want to break into the software engineering industry

- People who have had some success in mainstream software engineering careers, but are now bored and want to try something new

- People who want are thinking about going to graduate school in CS/ML/AI/NLP and want some experience doing research in that area

I'm happy to talk more about the specifics in person. Email me at daniel dot burfoot at gmail. Unfortunately I cannot sponsor visas.

The PanLab for Precision Psychiatry and Translational Neuroscience is searching for a Research Data Analyst and Engineer to build and improve upon our treatment prediction software pipeline, which will help guide an individual to the depression/anxiety treatment that is most effective for them. Our pipeline is the first of its kind and currently outputs the different ways brain circuitry can become dysfunctional. The candidate will use machine learning and statistical techniques in our large datasets to analyze the outputs of our current pipeline and create new treatment prediction models.

The PanLab is a research group at Stanford University that aims to use brain imaging to improve our understanding and treatment of mental health conditions. Our current projects focus on depression and anxiety, with research that embraces individual differences. We use a variety of tools such as MRI, EEG, behavioral testing, genetics, symptoms, and daily functioning data, in order to match an individual with the best treatment for them, whether that is an antidepressant, psychotherapy, TMS, lifestyle changes, etc.

We are looking for a candidate with strong data analysis and software engineering experience, but no neuroimaging experience is required! As we are a 30-person team of psychiatrists, neuroscientists, doctors, clinical psychologists, and data scientists, the ability to communicate technical ideas across a range of experiences is vital. Most importantly, we seek someone self-motivated, imaginative, and genuinely excited to dig into our datasets and to explore novel, reliable, and effective ways to help individuals suffering from mental illness.

Sr. Software Engineer @ Kinetica (Machine Learning & Distributed Systems) https://goo.gl/MnZ9ug
Kinetica seeks a Senior Software Engineer with Python and Distributed Systems experience. The Senior Software Engineer will be joining an accomplished team to help build out a green-field project -- a new product line for our company.

Our team of engineers is building out a scalable, distributed machine learning and data science platform with tight integrations and pipelines to a distributed, sharded GPU-powered database. This means the product would need to be developed in Linux and operate inside containers (Docker for us), work in a container-orchestrated environment (Kubernetes for us), operate in a scalable resource managed system (GPUs via Kubernetes) and interact with complex analytical systems (TensorFlow, etc.) Some of this, you’ll already be familiar with, and some of it we’ll learn along the way.

The Senior Software Engineer would work closely with the Product Owner to build out the product in Python and integrate all other parts (TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and our GPU-powered DB) using Python bindings to build and deliver an overall product (a REST API.) This role focuses on the backend and will interface with our front-end engineers who will write a ReactJS application atop the REST API.

The Company

We are a FinTech startup that just raised our Series A. We work with small businesses to help them take control of their cashflow.

Stack as of today: Ruby on Rails, Angular, Heroku

What we're looking for: Someone with 10+ years of experience as a developer, who is on (and wants to stay on) a technical career path.

Deep Learning Retreat | Senior Resident mentor | Fremont, CA | Full-time | https://deeplearningretreat.com/
Deep learning Retreat (DLR) is the first deep learning school in the world. We train people who want to either:

- Have a job in a tech company

- Have tons of impact by going alone on their own startup or doing ‘good’

We make sure we fulfill those two customer needs by giving them the best environment to produce an impressive portfolio project.

The more we talk to companies interviewing today, the more apparent it is: A portfolio project is decisive when making hiring judgments. Jeremy Howard recommends it. Andrew Ng recommends it. Why? It’s far better at discriminating talent than any other proxy (CVs don’t work; pedigree doesn’t work; puzzles don’t work). DLR focus is to help you write the best portfolio project you could; in that sense, it’s like a writer’s retreat, where one goes to finish your masterpiece novel. We use online videos to cover the theory, but focus on project-based, peer-learning methods that are completely hands on. When you come out of the door, you should be holding a project that proves you can write damn good code and makes you unstoppable in interviews… or an extremely desirable partner for social impact projects or startups.

Brex (brex.com) | San Francisco, CA | On-site only | Full-time | Visa
What we bring:

- An environment where it matters to make the right design decisions the first time. "Move fast and break things" doesn't really work for the type of system that we build. We take less technical debt than other companies.

- At Brex, engineers make the product decisions with input from business people, instead of business / product people making decisions with input from engineers

- We'd rather have one strong, well-compensated engineer instead of having 5 mediocre engineers. Our customers are fine with fewer features, but are not ok with broken features.

- Small, accountable and autonomous teams of amazing people, eager to learn, teach and constantly improve our way of working.

- We believe that great individual contributors generate as much (or more!) value as engineering managers, and we compensate them accordingly.

What you'll bring:

- Exceptional technical background.

- Strong sense of ownership and accountability for what you're building. What you build today will be the foundation for dozens of other systems in the future.

- Frankness on discussing technical matters. If you disagree with how things are being done, we encourage you to speak up. You can attack an idea without attacking the person behind it.

- Passion for code. We love people that take pride in and love programming, especially if they've done so since a very young age.

- Experience in Haskell, Scala, Functional Programming, Elixir or F# is a plus

Does Brex sound like home? We'd love to meet you: https://jobs.lever.co/brex/befd063b-976e-4bb1-835f-e4564dee4...

We are looking for engineers to join both our "engine" and "front-end" development teams. Engine development is more focused on solving the problems in the hot path of transaction processing whereas front-end development handles customer facing tools and analytics (it should be noted frontend is cross functional and owns their whole stack including the backend APIs, storage and orchestration).

You might be a backend or frontend developer, a bit of both or someone wishing to move into a full-stack role after focusing more on front/backend in the past. Either way we'd like to hear from you.

Apply: https://bboxx.workable.com/jobs/774071

About BBOXX

Lack of energy access in sub-Saharan Africa is a significant problem, with more than 600 million people currently without mains electricity supply. In Rwanda, 9.5 million people or 81% of the population cannot access mains electricity, which has a negative impact on quality of life and limits people's chances of achieving economic prosperity.

BBOXX is helping to address this issue by providing off-grid communities in developing countries with affordable energy solutions. BBOXX customers typically use a Pay-As-You-Go payment method, which enables very low income customers access to electricity at home that they would otherwise not be able to afford. To date BBOXX has installed more than 150,000 systems and provided around 750,000 people with access to energy.

Snapcraft (https://snapcraft.io) | Senior Software Engineer | REMOTE | Full time
The Snapcraft team at Canonical (Ubuntu) are trying to make it easy to deliver app updates to all Linux-based cloud, IoT, and desktop systems safely (confinement, rollbacks) and automatically.

We're motivated by making developers' lives easier. We want to see people spend time on what makes their app unique and interesting, not on packaging. We also understand that developers currently face an impossible choice between few updates to lower the risk of breakage and frequent updates to lower the risk of compromise.

The open position is for a Senior Software Engineer. We want someone with years of war stories building developer tools to help re-architect the core of Snapcraft (https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft). It needs to integrate deep into Python, Node, Ruby, Electron, and others so that releasing your app for tens of millions of Linux users is a natural extension of setup.py or npm run.

Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineers; Product Managers; Data Scientists | San Francisco, CA | Onsite
Academia.edu is addressing two problems:

- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.

- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.

It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.

With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.

With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community.

Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."

We are looking to hire full stack software engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

University of Pennsylvania | Philadelphia, PA | ONSITE | https://www.waytohealth.org/
Way to Health is a patient engagement and research platform which has been used to power over 100 research studies and clinical programs improving the health of our patients. As just one example, the Heart Safe Motherhood program uses our platform to text postpartum mothers about their blood pressure for 10 days, allowing us to catch mothers at risk for preeclampsia long before they would otherwise show up in an ambulance.

As we scale from research to clinical and commercial use, the Software Developers on our team play a critical role in extending and supporting the platform - designing and building new features to enable novel patient engagement strategies, improving the user interface for our patients and providers, and troubleshooting issues affecting our users.

This position requires strong technical ability to design and build web applications and APIs, clear communication with team members and users to deeply understand user needs, and creativity to solve issues and meet requirements while paying off rather than accruing technical debt.

Bachelors degree and minimum 3 years experience in web development required. We use mostly PHP and Vue.js so experience in either of those is a plus, but we will consider candidates with experience in other backend or frontend frameworks. An interest in medicine, research, and/or patient engagement is always great - we are an excited and engaged team who loves what we do and the impact that we can make.

Divvy Homes | Sr. Software Engineer (full-stack) | (ONSITE) San Francisco, CA | www.divvyhomes.com
The Gist

At Divvy, we're helping renters become homeowners by letting our customers buy back pieces of their home over time. Our goal is for our customers to accrue enough equity in their homes to use as a down payment for a traditional mortgage.

The Company

Over the past year, we’ve worked hard to build an exceptional team, raise over $30 million in funding, and provide homes for dozens of families, meaningfully changing their financial future. Our customers choose any home for sale, and Divvy buys it on their behalf. The customer leases the home back from us while building equity credits along the way, preparing to buy the home at the end of their lease. Our customers get to live in their future home today, while buying fractions of the home over time.

The Job

We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer passionate about using their creativity and talent to make access to homeownership more accessible. In this role, you’ll be part of the engineering team building our consumer, agent and administrative products. At Divvy, you’ll own your projects from start to finish and help to scale our platform to thousands of new applicants and multiple new markets. You’ll report directly to Divvy’s CTO and work alongside a team of 3-5 software engineers.

Apply directly at: https://angel.co/divvy-homes/jobs/375496-software-engineer-f....

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me directly at alex (at) divvyhomes.com !

Dahlia Lights | Mobile Engineer | Bay Area, CA | Full Time | Onsite | http://www.dahlialights.com
Dahlia Lights is building the first computer vision enabled lighting companion. Our sensing module is installed in a corner and works with smart lights like Philips Hue to map a room and its lighting. With this information we automatically generate a range of lighting scenes for your favorite activities. It’s like having your very own lighting designer! We can also detect presence so your lights will turn on when you enter a room, and only turn off once you leave. You can also set up your lights to change depending on what’s going on in a room. For example, you can set your lights to fade into a reading mode when you sit in your favorite reading chair at night.

Job Description As a Mobile Engineer at Dahlia Lights, you will be a core member of the engineering team defining and building a new kind of lighting product that will bring great joy to people’s lives. Since you will be an early member of the team, you will need to learn quickly while contributing to the product and company in many ways. You will have a lot of freedom and say in defining the technologies and features we develop.

Your focus will be on developing our mobile app using React Native. This includes developing the UI, the front-end architecture, and working with smart product APIs. Ideally, you will also be able to help out with other engineering problems such as maintaining back-end services and databases. Our mobile app is the main way our users interact with our product, making it an incredibly important component to the product experience. A focus on user experience with an attention to detail is incredibly important.

Giftly | REMOTE | Full-stack engineer | www.giftly.com
This is a unique opportunity: you can live anywhere in the world and work whenever you want as long as you stay coordinated with the team, deliver high-quality code, and consistently meet deadlines. This is a good role for someone who has solid experience and wants to take on significant responsibility in order to enjoy that flexibility.

About Giftly: Giftly is a successful e-commerce startup that has grown from a VC-backed seed round in 2011 into a profitable company.

The core Giftly service is a fairly mature gift card service, with hundreds of thousands of users and millions of dollars being processed annually. We are working on launching a brand new gift card product that will run alongside the existing service.

The role: We are searching for an experienced full-stack engineer to play a crucial role in both maintaining the core service and developing this new product. In this role, you will be responsible for front-end and back-end development and deployment infrastructure.

The CTO, who’s been with the company for over 5 years, will be a resource for institutional knowledge, collaboration, and problem-solving, but you’ll be encouraged and empowered to make your own architecture and implementation decisions. You will get to own the application and be involved in key product strategy decisions and setting high-level priorities.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers. We work with more than a dozen architectures including PowerPC/ppc, MIPS, ARM/Thumb/AArch64, x86/x64/Intel, DSPs, and microcontrollers. We hire from no-degree to PhD. Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

Location hints: Pick Arlington for a car-free life, subway included. Pick Florida or Texas to live in a place with solid gun rights and no state income tax. Pick Florida for almost no traffic or commute, surfing, and houses that commonly go for $150,000 to $450,000.

Stasis Labs | DevOps & Security Contractor | 2 - 3 month contract | Onsite (Los Angeles) or Remote | https://stasislabs.com
We're looking for an AWS / infrastructure / devops consultant with experience architecting for HIPAA. We know at a high level what we need to do to achieve HIPAA compliance, but want a consultant with enough experience around HIPAA that they can be interpreting certain high-level requirements into action items as far as changing our AWS infrastructure without us burning ourselves from interpreting something incorrectly. Having node.js experience (and interest on backend code-writing) is an optional plus.

We have an existing infrastructure that will require config tweaks (like adding encryption at rest to some services), expanding the logging capability, expanding alerting, and a few other to-dos.

Open to working with people in U.S. or India timezones. We're in LA and Bangalore but remote is fine. Expected timeframe would be fulltime Aug - Sept (or Oct if needed).

We're growing quickly and tackling a wide range of problems - ranging from migrating an information-rich Angular application to React, making our data pipeline real time, to running the quickest and most efficient real time bidding auctions.

Atrium | DevOps Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Mid-Level Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Full-time | ONSITE | www.atrium.co
Our tech stack: React, Vue, and GraphQL on the front end, Ruby on Rails on the back with some Node+typescript. Postgres database, hosted on AWS. Mostly python on our ML side. Looking for very smart engineers who want to build a unique web app whose end users are in the same room as you.

Laws are the operating system on top of which all businesses operate. Without legal infrastructure, businesses and individuals would not be able to transact with trust that their counterparties will be held accountable. This trust has set the stage for a high degree of economic growth in America, and as laws have become more complex over time, interpreting and advising on the law has become an increasingly specialized profession.

Along with the law, regulation has also increased as a mechanism to assure the quality of legal professionals. Consequently, a massive legal industry has risen, and navigating the law has become an opaque, slow, and expensive process. Because of the regulatory hurdles in forming startup law firms, competition in providing legal services is soft, and technology and process improvements for clients do not happen as quickly as in other industries. Today, business managers do not have transparency into legal projects, and often view legal as a blocker to the goals they want to accomplish.

Atrium’s vision is to democratize and organize enterprises’ access to legal data, legal advice, and legal work. We will achieve this vision by combining the expertise of a full service law firm with the technology development processes and growth ambitions of Silicon Valley. This will enable transparent, fast, and cost competitive legal services for corporations.

Atrium has the potential to be a hugely impactful company that brings corporate legal services to the 21st century.

King & Union | Front-end developer and Python developer | Washington, DC | ONSITE FULL-TIME
The point: We are an information security/threat intelligence company. Our goal is to make the threat intelligence process run more smoothly and help organizations share threat data better. Our web app pulls threat information (both our own and via external APIs) into a graph and enables real-time collaboration and sharing of the information on the graph. (If you're aware of the tools, think of combining Google Docs with a graph editor like Maltego and mix in some process automation.)

What we're looking for: We're looking for two positions: one a mid/advanced front-end developer for the front end of our web-based application; the other a mid/advanced back-end developer. The front-end is built with React/Microcosm/Material/Vis.js, and it talks to our backend using a mix of REST and WebSockets. The back-end is built in Python with Django/Django Channels. Ideally, the UI person we're looking for would be comfortable doing both the React programming side of things as well as the HTML/CSS/layout work, and the backend person would be comfortable with some Golang/command line work. There would also be some design work as we roll out new features to the site and migrate data graph db in the near future.

Perks of the job: early round shares, competitive salary, 401k, & healthcare benefits. Also, we work from home a lot and our focus is on getting the work done, not on face time.

A bit about us: We are a pre-A-round startup. We have a working product and paying customers, so we're in a good spot financially. We are based in Alexandria, VA but as mentioned above, working from home is common. We tend to meet up in Alexandria once a week.

We encourage all who are interested to contact us. You can reach me at: aaron@kingandunion.com

Messari is a venture-backed startup building open data for cryptoassets. Our mission is to promote transparency and smarter decision-making within this emerging ecosystem by building a free, global, and open-source data library for cryptoasset projects.

We think crypto is great, but there are way too many scams. We want to give investors the tools to separate the wheat from the chaff, and apply new models for open source contributions and self-regulation to financial services along the way.

We are looking for a few talented team members:

- Infrastructure engineer to help design, architect, and build our scalable data systems. Experience working with blockchain data is great, but this will be a boring old low-latency, high capacity centralized database for the foreseeable future.

- Web UI/UX Designer to take ownership of the UI/UX vision for our product in its entirety, and drive it from ideation to implementation. Our standard is 'so easy a regulator can grock it', so you'll have your work cut out for you.

- Research analyst to create thematic and macro focused reports for the cryptoasset industry, and help launch our curated content products.

This is an ideal opportunity if you are interested in crypto, but turned off by some of the excesses in the industry. We are an experienced, mission driven team looking to drive the asset class forward. Our team has a mix of startup and institutional experience at Microsoft, Palantir, Bloomberg, Tower Research, Digital Currency Group, Coindesk, JP Morgan, S&P, and the SEC.

* NO AGENCIES OR RECRUITERS PLEASE *
Wildfish - https://wildfish.com

We're a London based consultancy who work mainly with Django.

We're looking for a full stack developer to join us, ideally permanently but will consider freelance too. Primarily you'll be working on our client sites maintaining and developing Django web applications and mobile APIs, but also working on some of our own products and open source projects (https://github.com/wildfish/).

Everyone in our organisation is technical, all of us working remotely, although it's handy if you're within distance of London for meetings occasionally. We're ideally looking for someone in the UK, but will possibly consider someone overseas with excellent English in a similar timezone. Some of the things we use, which it would be good for you to know some of:

- Python/Django [Essential]

- HTML/CSS/Javascript [Essential]

- Twitter Bootstrap

- React / React Native

- PostgreSQL

- Ubuntu Linux Server Admin

- Docker

- AWS, GCE, Kubernetes

The most important thing is that you must be passionate about your craft, and eager to share and learn with others who feel the same. You'll need to be able to work autonomously, so it's important that you're the sort of person who has attention to detail and can be self motivated.

Please email work@wildfish.com, including the salary or rate you're looking for, along with a list of 3 Django apps you like to use in projects, and a link to any code you have available online. Please also mention if you have any interest in cryptocurrency.

Thanks :)

Starrett Bytewise Development | Columbus, GA | Software Engineer II | Full Time | Onsite
Who is Starrett-Bytewise?

Starrett-Bytewise is a growing company that is an industry leader in designing and building laser-based, non-contact measurement equipment. Based in Columbus, Georgia, with a worldwide presence, Starrett-Bytewise has an in-house technical team that designs the mechanical, electrical, and sensor components for our systems as well as develops all of our own software. We value challenge in the work place and seek out those with a tinkering mindset and a passion for what they do.

What Are We Looking For?

We’re looking for a software developer with two to five years’ experience in C++/C# that is seeking a new challenge. You should be comfortable working with complex algorithms, be well versed in object oriented design, have a strong background in signal processing, and know the fundamentals of GUI frameworks. You will need a B.S. in Software Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, or equivalent discipline. A Master’s Degree within one of these fields is a significant advantage. You may need to travel every once in a while (up to 10%), including internationally. Most importantly, you should be someone that is looking to push the boundaries and test your skills on a daily basis.

The job?

We’ve got a pretty complex source code that we want to modernize. You would take a little time to familiarize yourself with it and how it works then start a ground-up rebuild of the code. Rewrite, rework, cut-and-paste, slash-and-burn, we don’t care - but here’s the catch - our software is the best in our industry and you’re going to be held to a very high standard for performance, functionality, and user friendliness. Our customers expect a lot from us and we will deliver on that. The re-write is intended to increase our technical edge over the competition and ensure long-term product success. Once you’re done with the re-write, you’ll begin adding new features and functionality to keep the product in its leadership position.

What’s in it for you?

- Living in beautiful Columbus, Georgia with a low cost of living

- Highly competitive compensation

- Health and disability insurance plan

- Profit sharing

- 401k with employer matching

- Employee stock purchase plan

I've been a developer for quite some time, and professionally for over 12 years. Like many of you, I've been frustrated with the software development process and the manual toil we have around that process - we want to solve problems in software, not in the way we write, test and deploy it!

That's why I'm excited by what my team at Walmart Labs does - the Developer Experience Tools team exists to create an amazing experience for the developer both within the Walmart Organization and outside with our Open Source contributions (see: http://testarmada.io/).

I'm hiring right now, for a Staff level engineer to work on an exciting, full-featured set of UIs (portals, dashboards, configuration wizards) and associated tools and services.

We use javascript , nodejs, reactjs, redux and graphql heavily, but we're very much of the opinion that you should use the right tool for the job so there are no unnecessary limitations.

Our Carlsbad office is AWESOME, and the location - reasonably close to San Diego, right next to the ocean - is pretty fantastic.

If you’d like to find out more or just chat about the role, message me here - or you can apply here: https://careers.walmart.com/us/jobs/1016758BR-staff-software...

Would be amazing to speak to folks who want to find cool ways to take all the hassle out of developing software. I don't care if you have a degree or not.

You'd be joining a great team with some excellent fellow engineers. No recruiters please, No agencies. Please reach out if you are interested in the role for yourself!

Namshi.com | Dubai |Sr Backend Engineers & Cybersecurity Engineer | Full-time | Onsite | Visa + Relocation assistance | https://namshi.com
Founded in 2011, Namshi is the biggest fashion e-commerce retailer in the Middle East.

My name is Joe, a backend engineer here at Namshi. During the past 2 years, I have really enjoyed working as part of the tech team. In particular, I love: 1- Working with empathetic and smart managers, both technical and non-technical. 2- The various opportunities to make an impact. 3- Opportunities to take ownership. 4- Working as a team where one supports each other. 5- No politics or BS meetings :slightly_smiling_face:

Sr. Backend Engineer

====================

As a Sr. Backend Engineer, you’ll be tasked to work on a spectrum of services ranging from our customer-facing APIs to tools that power our logistics infrastructure. We are a very pragmatic and experienced team, so from time to time, you will see engineers busy TDDing on a feature, whereas at other times we’re straight to live. We pride of being a heterogeneous team that’s experienced to know how and when to abstract.

Security Engineer:

==================

As a Security Engineer, you’ll be tasked with running internal assessments, ranging from pentesting our cloud infrastructure to social engineering around the office, review our security policies and define the best strategy to improve our posture. In addition to that, you will be actively collaborating with external researchers through our HackerOne program, which is going to be directly under your responsibility. On top of this, as the months will go by, you will probably spend time training both our technical and non-technical staff to raise awareness and make sure we got the basics covered.

We have a microservice architecture where we use tools such as Node.js, Python, Go, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud, React, Redis etc.

To apply please send an email with your resume to work-in-tech@namshi.com. Or you can also email me directly at joe.jean@namshi.com.

Tempo Automation | Full-Stack Software Engineer | SF | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://www.tempoautomation.com
Tempo operates a factory in SF to produce printed circuit boards extremely quickly - in doing so, we give our customers the physical equivalent of a fast compiler, enabling them to turn their designs into real products significantly faster than they could before. Our customers build rockets, drones, medical devices, and much more - working at Tempo means you can accelerate all of these industries at once. Providing a system to produce circuit boards quickly and correctly means we're both a software shop and an advanced manufacturer. Our software team is still pretty small (9 engineers) which means any new hires will still have an outsize impact on the direction of our technology, and on the company as a whole. We love hiring strong generalists [python experience highly preferred] who take initiative and act as part-time PMs when they're working on projects. Some projects you might work on: - Offering real-time, automated manufacturing feedback based on certain parameters of our customers' designs. Think linting for hardware.

  - Optimizing our factory processes with machine learning and scheduling algorithms.

  - Encoding the three-dimensional structure of each order's components (e.g. resistors, capacitors) for our assembly robots, in order to speed up assembly and ensure minimal manufacturing defects.

  - Optimizing our automated optical inspection machine to make it faster than any in the industry.
Tech Stack: Python | Django | React | Redux | PostgreSQL | AWS
We're also excited to be moving into a MUCH larger factory (>4x the floor space) in SoMa in a couple months, which means you'll see that space evolve from nothing into an enormous, high-tech manufacturing complex. If you're interested, please apply at https://www.tempoautomation.com/careers or send a note to austin [at] tempoautomation [dot] com.

LendKey enables these community financial institutions to bring loans to consumers online, making the end-to-end lending process easy & simple for both borrowers and lenders.

We're looking for top tech talent in software, platform, data engineering, and UX. What we're seeking in all of these roles: Team-members who are open to learning new technologies. Brave enough to implement solutions to challenging problems. Can be hands-on but also strategic. Willing to speak your mind but kind to others when doing it. We're Ruby on Rails, Linux, Docker, but we're actively searching for the next tool for the job. For data/reporting we are a SQL Server and MySQL shop, looking for Apache Hadoop, Kafka, Airflow and Amazon Redshift experience.

Shoot me an email at tony (dot) baron at-sign lendkey.com with resume or questions! Don't quite fit and things sound interesting? Let's see if we can work something out, anyway.

Strive Talent | Full-stack Engineer + Front-end product engineer | FULL-TIME ONSITE | San Francisco, CA | https://www.strivetalent.com/
Hey HN! I'm Jesse, the head of engineering at Strive Talent. My email is jesse@strivetalent.com. Previously, I co-founded Dev Bootcamp (acquired by Kaplan) and Everlane.

Strive Talent is a seed-stage, mission-driven startup dedicated to giving everyone a fair shot at a great career. Right now we help companies around the US staff sales and customer support jobs with candidates that would typically be overlooked. A typical hiring manager spends ~6 seconds per resume to evaluate whether a candidate should be given an interview. Instead, we administer a combination of cognitive tests, work-sample tests, and phone screenings, which allow us to evaluate a candidate according to the traits that actually determine their ability to do the job.

Our team is small, but we're well-funded: https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/24/stressing-aptitude-over-ac...

If you're interested, please send a resume and a paragraph explaining what it is about Strive that resonates with you to: jesse@strivetalent.com

Strive is a great place to join if any of the following are true:

• You care about connecting people with dignified livelihoods.

• You care about people getting jobs based on their ability to do the work, and not their pedigree.

• You want to come in to work each day and be able to ask, "How many people got a better job yesterday because of us?"

• You want to join an early-stage startup where there are still a lot of open product and technical questions.

Our core platform is built using Rails, React, PostreSQL, and other standard moving parts. Experience is those technologies isn't required, but evidence of skill and adaptability are.

Contract Simply (YC S17) | Austin, TX | Product Manager | Full-Time | Onsite
Contract Simply (https://contractsimply.com) is looking for a Senior Product Manager in Austin or is willing to relocate.

ABOUT US

Contract Simply is building the first A.I., machine learning platform for the $900B US construction lending market. We help banks manage their large and complex construction loan portfolio using intelligent automation and integrated payments. Unlike a typical loan, a construction loan isn’t a single payment. Instead, it’s broken up into monthly payments called draws. That monthly draw process is complicated, with many stakeholders and hundreds or thousands of documents. Currently, all of this is managed with excel spreadsheets, PDFs, emails, and paper checks.

Our software helps lenders, developers, and other stakeholders produce and process this documentation automatically, leading to fewer errors, faster payments, and more profitable loans.

We’re currently small (10 employees), YC-backed, and are already working with several of the largest lenders in the industry. You’d be working directly with the founders in a company that values being purposeful, efficient, authentic, transparent, curious, and agile.

ABOUT YOU / THE ROLE

We’re looking for a product manager who is happy to take ownership of the product lifecycle and who is not afraid to get their hands dirty. Your key responsibilities will be to set the medium-term vision and strategy of the product and communicate that strategy to all of the relevant participants and stakeholders.

We offer competitive pay and benefits, plus equity. Our culture is open, transparent, and fun. We work hard, but also take time for our families, friends, and hobbies.

If you're interested, please contact me at andrew@contractsimply.com. You can also read more about the job and requirements at https://angel.co/contract-simply/jobs/322111-sr-product-mana...

Truss | Software Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer | San Francisco or REMOTE | https://truss.works
Particularly interested in Ruby/React and Javascript/React at this time.

Truss solves complex technical problems for the private sector and government. We helped rebuild Healthcare.gov after its public failure in 2013. We seek the highest standard both in terms of the technology we build, and the way we run our company. We'd love to chat with you.

We are a software consultancy known for pragmatism, autonomy, expertise, and trust. We build strong relationships with our clients, contractors, and employees and we believe that this is fundamental to doing great work. As a Truss engineer you will facilitate bringing Truss values (https://truss.works/values/) to those truly trying to make a difference in our government, and enable them to understand what their citizens actually need rather than implementing a perceived solution.

Here are some of the things we care about: * Great communication! Including thoughtful listening skills, the ability to express complex ideas clearly and succinctly, and the ability to communicate well in writing * The ability to deal well with ambiguity and act with autonomy * Technology-agnostic and pragmatic engineering sensibility, focused on solving key problems for the customer, not the tools * Proficiency in at least one commonly used programming language, such as Python, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Java, etc. * Experience deploying at least one application that other people use * Have held at least one engineering position post-education * Initiative, curiosity, a bias for action, and a problem-solving attitude

We expect all Truss engineers to consistently develop new skills, and cross-train into new disciplines outside of their current areas of expertise.

Los Angeles | CTO / Head of Engineering | $50k - $150k and/or 5% to 20% equity | Early Stage
High-level pitch of product Renters get 15% of their rent back, landlords get responsible long term renters.

Product Colibrin has developed a patent-pending "Renter Fund" technology which applies time-tested behavioral economic models, similar to credit card cash-back programs or airline points, to create a mutually beneficial outcome for both renters and their landlords. Renters that use Colibrin's "Renter Fund" can receive up to 15% of their cumulative rent payments back when they move out if they reside in a property for a minimum number of years. Landlords and real estate investors that use Colibrin's Renter Fund can receive higher than average returns since their properties will have lower vacancy rates, lower management fees, lower repair costs, and higher cash-flows -- resulting in a higher NOI.

Why us? We are from MIT Sloan, one of the largest real estate holding families in Beverly is in our advisory group, the family that discovered fuzzy logic at MIT is one of our investors. We have a product that can scale quickly, decentralize real estate ownership, and creates a win-win scenario for our market participants.

The other co-founder studied at UC Berkeley and MIT Sloan, has been a software developer and product manager. We already have strong interest from renters and landlords. We are at the early stage and are expecting our valuation to grow 100x in the coming years. We can provide you a dedicated office area.

Your title CTO / Head of Engineering / Co-founder

Description Lead all things software development. You will be our first co-founder.

Skills - Backend: Java and Play Framework (optional), MySQL - Frontend: HTML, Javascript, any framework - Business accumen

Salary / Equity - To start $50k per year as contractor - After 3-months and completion of first web application salary can increase to $150k per year - The company is currently valued at $2m, and you will receive 5% to 15% vested across four years.

Haplo | London | ONSITE | Graduate Software Engineer
Are you graduating this summer? Haplo will help you get the best possible start to your career as a software developer.

https://haplo-services.com/jobs/new-graduates

Every year, new graduates join our team, and they ship working features to our clients within their first two weeks. We support their growth in a direction which suits them, whether that's a focus on writing code, taking a client-facing role, or developing a particular specialism.

We can do this because we've really thought about how to build a team, and a way of developing software, that can enable someone at the beginning of their career to realise their potential as quickly as they can.

Joining us will give you a wide range of experience across the full software development lifecycle, and you'll make an important contribution to your team.

You'll be building hosted products used by universities to manage their research:

* PhD Manager is our market leading system to manage PhD programmes, helping everyone work together and PhD researchers to complete their doctorate.

* Ethics Monitor enables universities to ensure that all research is safe and ethical.

* Haplo Research Manager brings together the full lifecycle of research, from the start of the project to the publication of results.

Our products are written on top of our open source platform, designed for building applications which manage large amounts of semi-structured data with a polished user experience.

While ideal, a computer science degree isn't essential, as long as you've written software as part of your degree or outside your studies. You'll mainly be working in server-side JavaScript, but don't need to have used this before.

Haplo is an equal opportunities employer, and our inclusive team welcomes colleagues from all backgrounds: https://haplo-services.com/about/who

You must have a right to work in the UK.

Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time
Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations.

Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers. The team previously worked together on a distributed search and data management startup and sold the company a few years back.

What we are looking for:

Fast, deliberate learners eager to translate concept into practice OR experienced hands ready to take significant design ownership

Strong computer science fundamentals, including algorithms and data structures

Experience with one of the following through professional, academic, or personal work:

- Database design and implementation (query processing/planning, database/storage engines)

- Language design and implementation (parser generators, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)

- Logic programming (Prolog, Datalog, SAT/SMT solvers, etc.)

- Optimization (constraint satisfaction, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, etc.)

Language experience: C / Rust

Self-starting attitude with strong communication skills (especially written)

The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there. If you believe that spreadsheets are not the last word in end-user programming, reach out to us (stephen [at] fac.tt) and tell us a little about yourself (bio, resume, or LinkedIn). We’d love to hear from you and show you what we’ve been up to!

At numo (https://www.numo.com), we create and incubate new "fintech" companies. We have the good fortune of starting from a clean slate (i.e., no legacy code) and are able to use the latest and greatest frameworks and tools.

We are actively working on our first product, a banking app for the freelance/gig economy workforce. We've chosen to use Flutter as our mobile framework and are ideally looking for someone with actual Flutter experience. Given it is a new framework, we are of course willing to talk to folks with real world mobile experience on iOS and/or Android (hopefully both).

Our backend is Scala/Akka running at AWS.

Our strong preference is to have an on-site developer, but we are willing to contemplate remote arrangements for exceptional candidates. In this case, travel to our Pittsburgh headquarters would be required (and frequent in the beginning).

We’ve set out to make this is easy, impactful. rorodata makes it easy to go from idea to deployment quickly, users can scale as they grow.

Our goal is let data scientists focus on core business problem and abstract out the infrastructure.

DefenseStorm | DevOps Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Junior Software Engineer | Full-Time | ONSITE | Seattle | https://www.defensestorm.com/
At DefenseStorm, we help detect and stop cyberattacks on banks and credit unions.

Networks make a lot of logs - some of them are very important but there is huge volume of noise. We ingest all of our customers’ network logs, and then customers can quickly search through them, set alerts, investigate threats, and generate reports. Our tools make it easy to track and demonstrate compliance with financial cybersecurity regulations and guidelines - which has shortened many of our customers’ arduous ~3 month audit preparations to just a couple weeks. Our customers are very happy, which makes work more fun.

  I actually got hired here through an HN Who’s Hiring post about 3 years ago!  

Junior and Senior Software Engineers: Our stack is primarily Java, Elasticsearch, AWS, Angular, Typescript, Postgresql. Dev-ops and cybersecurity experience are ideal, but not required. We’re big on code review - use phabricator. Have great monitoring and a nice CI system so deployment is mostly painless while still being safe. Really good engineering culture: you will learn and become a better programmer by working with this team - I have.   

DevOps Engineer: Our stack is microservices running on AWS, Elasticsearch and Postgresql. We use Chef and Terraform to manage it all and Sensu, InfluxDB, and Grafana to monitor it. We're big on automation and Infrastructure as Code and have a CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure changes. Working at a startup is fun - you get to wear many hats and work up	and down the stack. We love open source, both using it and contributing back to projects.  

Dog friendly office. Every Tuesday we do a ‘Topic Sync’ to share knowledge on technical topics for an hour - nice way to continue learning. Keg, espresso machine, wall of snacks. Free lunches on Wednesday. Have had some cool guest speakers in the cybersecurity space, and we send some team members to DEFCON and other security conferences each year to stay on top of new developments. It’s a fun place to work. Relocation expenses are available for Senior and DevOps Engineer candidates.

IPUMS | ipums.org | Data Engineer | Minneapolis, MN | Onsite | Full-Time
IPUMS is a leader in the field of quantitative social science research and the largest disseminator of census and demographic data to the world’s academic research community. Or, to put it another way - we’re on a mission to gather, process, link and publish billions of records spanning hundreds of years and more than 100 countries to demographers, historians, economists, environmental scientists, journalists, policymakers, and others around the globe, who then use the data to do amazing research and make the world a better place.

We are currently seeking a software developer to join our data linking team that is working on large scale data manipulation and creating highly performant distributed software systems. In this role, you will be developing software that links records representing the same individual and their family relationships across every US Census from 1850 - 1940. There are no consistent identifiers across historical censuses, so sophisticated matching algorithms will be required. You will be building on research and IT effort from the past decade to create a dataset that, once released, will enable critical new avenues of research for demographers and historians. This work will also lead to additional data linking opportunities for datasets from around the world and throughout history. You will be working in close collaboration with expert historians, demographers, and data scientists. We use Apache Spark (PySpark and SparkSQL) for a majority of our data processing, with C++ in critical areas. This is an excellent opportunity to grow your career with a cutting -edge software shop at the University of Minnesota and contribute to work that has impact around the globe.

Required Skills: BA/BS degree required. Two years of work experience in the areas of application/web/systems development with a related BA/BS degree, or four years of work experience in the areas of application/web/systems development with a non-related BA/BS degree.

This role requires technical experience and proficiency with:

- Experience developing software for high performance and/or distributed computing

- Experience with databases (relational or NoSQL)

- Large dataset manipulation

- Linux/UNIX operating systems, including command-line

Knotel | multiple positions | New York, NY | onsite | Full-time | https://knotel.com
Knotel is a fast growing real estate startup that is inventing new ways to get things done in a traditional industry. Led by veteran founders, Knotel creates custom headquarters for companies without any of the headaches. Whether for 20 or 500 people, for 6 months or 6 years, Knotel provides businesses the flexibility and design they need in office space so they can focus on their work.

Most companies no longer maintain their own server hardware because AWS offers more flexibility and obviates the need to have hardware on-site and IT folks managing and maintaining uptime. At Knotel we think we can provide something similar for office space -- allowing companies to have the ability to scale up and down like cloud servers and freeing them from the responsibility of managing space by having to find people to take over their long leases, do space build outs, hiring their own with facilities management, etc.

As a result, we have a ton of interesting tech challenges all up and down the stack. We are working on a canonical data model for storing all of the information on spaces so we can increase operational efficiency and transparency across the company. We are rolling out a data pipeline and ensuring all data flows into our data warehouse so everyone across the company can report on their key metrics. We are integrating with hardware in the physical space to track information like usage, temperature, and we are figuring out solutions for smart access control. We're looking to use computer vision to understand office utilization and flow within the office.

In brief, we have a ton of interesting problems to solve.

We're growing our engineering team in NYC significantly, starting with some key roles.

Today we're hiring a whole bunch of roles:

- Lead Full Stack Engineer https://grnh.se/91ad31da1 - Data Engineer https://grnh.se/d5c41fd31 - Data Analyst https://grnh.se/9b5847e81 - Senior DevOps Engineer https://grnh.se/e43371b81 - Full Stack Engineers (job post coming soon, in the meantime email me)

Wefunder | Full-stack Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE | Full-time
Wefunder is like "Kickstarter for investing". We've helped fund 204 startups and small businesses including flying cars, space rockets, breweries, hollywood studios, and potential Ebola cures. Every company we've funded is full of amazing stories.

We're the largest regulation crowdfunding platform currently on the market. We're growing and need to add reinforcements!

We're a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission to revitalize capitalism and keep the American dream alive. GDP growth is slowing. Wealth inequality is increasing.

We're reversing these trends by funding more deserving businesses across all of America, not solely tech startups in Silicon Valley.

Our Charter https://wefunder.com/charter

Worldwide, REMOTE, full time or part time -- 100% flexibility. $70-100/hr. Expert Interviewer at Karat (https://karat.io)
Work from anywhere in the world that has a solid internet connection. Work as much or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours -- you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else the training/time investment doesn't make as much sense from your end or ours.

I know the above might sound a little strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers' time interviewing; we help take the load off. We've done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we're well-funded and growing quickly as a result.

Because of this quickly-growing demand, we're looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you're strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.

Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather's like.

The application form is here: https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...

I know it's a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I'm happy to talk through any of it.

P.S. We're also hiring for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior engineers right now; for those we generally prefer local (Seattle) candidates, though we do cover relocation. More details on those here: https://karat.io/careers, or feel free to email me if you have any questions.

Analytical Flavor Systems | Manhattan - NYC | Full-Time | Onsite | http://www.Gastrograph.com/ Position: Full-Stack Engineer, Application Engineer, DevOps, Data Scientist Application & Data Stack: Javascript, React & React Native, GraphQL, Docker, Spark, R, postgres/MySQL, AWS
Team: we're a diverse 6 person company (across Data, Engineering, Chemistry, and Biz). Everyone gets trained as a professional taster.

Gastrograph AI is an artificial intelligence platform for modeling human sensory perception to predict consumer preferences of food & beverage products. We help food and beverage companies develop new products and optimize their existing brands by predicting the optimal flavor, aroma and texture for target consumer cohorts.

Our Services

_Innovation Management_: New product development, flavor profile optimization, & portfolio management (multi-product optimization).

_Cognitive Marketing_: Product description optimization to prime consumers to like a product more by purposely engineering a perception bias.

_Deep Market Insights_: Predictions for emergent market preferences by region and demographic.

The Position(s)

_Engineering_: We're currently looking in two specific areas: (1) full stack engineers with experience with React, GraphQL, and React Native to work on our web app for clients and our mobile app for tasters. (2) Streaming infrastructure focused engineers capable of integrating the data pipeline and outputs of machine learning models into an easy to use management platform.

_Data Science_: Data science is central to the value and insights we provide for our clients. We didn't build a data science team to optimize our product's marketing spend, sales funnel, or client retention – we built a data science team to build our product. We are a team of data scientists that understand our clients and turn nebulous business goal into quantitative decision metrics and predictive models to optimize those metrics. The extensive role of data scientists at Analytical Flavor Systems allows us to invest in their education across sensory perception (standard sensory science so they know what we're improving and replacing), tasting experiences (so they appreciate the products we work on and understand how the data is collected), production knowledge, and data science tear-downs (a meeting where the team collaboratively attempts to find and fix problems, try new techniques, and debate the philosophical implications of a model's construction).

Next Steps

Please contact Jason Cohen at JasonCEO@Gastrograph.com to apply.

NeoSmart Technologies is the world leader in disaster recovery. We've reverse engineered the entire Windows bootup procedure from BIOS POST to the login screen [0], and have developed automated tools to rebuild the entire thing from scratch with nary a user intervention: https://neosmart.net/EasyRE/

We're also the authors of the wildly famous EasyBCD [1] bootloader modification freeware, and numerous other system-related utilities. We fully embrace all types of technology, and ship code written in C, C++, C#, Rust, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more.

We are currently hiring for the following positions:

1) Researchers with a knack for experimentation and writing to expand our wiki of system errors by purposely breaking Windows virtual machines and then seeing what it takes to fix them. Example: https://neosmart.net/wiki/ntldr-is-missing/ and https://neosmart.net/wiki/ntdetect-failed/

The findings of your feedback would be used to both improve the automated repair process of tools like EasyRE and to directly benefit others searching for solutions online.

2) ASP.NET Core full-stack developers

We have a number of legacy ASP.NET MVC projects we would like to port to ASP.NET Core as well as new ASP.NET Core-based projects with frontends written in plain CSS/HTML + TypeScript (so not react or vue.js-based). These include our online ecommerce platforms, custom cms, software hosting system, and more.

3) C# developers with XAML design experience

We are looking to port a number of legacy .NET Framework 2.0 apps to either WPF or UWP, and are looking for talented desktop software developers to help us make the switch. We also have a number of open-source NuGet packages that need some love, including further documentation.

NoRedInk | Back-End, Front-End, Full-Stack, and Site Reliability Engineers | San Francisco, CA | REMOTE Pacific Time (PST) to Central European Time (CET)
We’re an ed-tech company on a mission to help all students become strong writers! Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 5 billion questions on our platform.

We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.

Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]

In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.

We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].

Tanium | Emeryville, CA (SF) or Morrisville, NC (RTP) or REMOTE | $300k+ total comp
https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. For networks with 20k+ computers, it's the best option by a long shot, and it scales to over a million endpoints without breaking a sweat.

Lt. Gen. Bill Bender, the recently-retired CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [1]

--

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I'll also called out a few positions below.

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, and self directed/unlimited vacation (most folks take 4~5 weeks).

I can't name salary ranges, but my total comp as a remote Senior Software Engineer is about $320k ($165k base, ~$100k bonus, and ~$55k stock).

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

--

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.

On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

--

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)

Remote or on site in Canada, Japan, Sweden, or USA.

Pivotal | Engineers, Designers, Product Managers, Data Scientists, Pre/Post-Sales Engineers, Ops, Sales, Admin | Locations worldwide | ONSITE
Pivotal's goal is to transform the way the world builds software. We mean it.

We value aptitude over alma mater, empathy over a list of APIs. It doesn't matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you're smart, empathetic and know some stuff, we want to work with you.

We have many offices worldwide including SF, NYC, Toronto, London, Denver, Palo Alto, Dublin, Tokyo, Sydney (pivotal.io/locations) and more. We have two main divisions: Pivotal Labs and R&D.

-- Pivotal Labs helps clients to become better at product development. For engineering we are rigorously agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code outside-in. Our product managers are focus on value and validation, our designers keep the user foremost in our minds. The goal is to teach the teachers. Our engineers pair with client engineers, often we pair designers and product managers as well. We have a growing data science practice. More broadly our services division includes field, data science, educators, app replatformers, even I lose track.

Not many people get to transform how people think and work. Why not you?

-- R&D is a big tent these days, encompassing two major cloud platforms (Pivotal Application Service & Pivotal Container Service), Pivotal Tracker, Spring Framework, Greenplum, Apache HAWQ (incubating), Gemfire / Apache Geode, BOSH and Concourse. We're adding Pivotal Function Service this year. We dogfood the cutting edge of our technology on our own commercial cloud, Pivotal Web Services, run by our awesome CloudOps team. We're the majority contributors to the Cloud Foundry project and we're a platinum CNCF member with rapidly-growing contributions to the k8s ecosystem. There is a lot happening right now and there are greenfield platform opportunities.

Not many people get to work on such systems. Why not you?

-- Generally

At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, excellent benefits and competitive pay. You'll work with competent people, kind people and go home at the same time every day. Ping pong isn't mandatory, but it's popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The NYC beer fridge has more IPAs than I prefer but I guess that's life in paradise.

-- Applying

To see open jobs, go to pivotal.io/careers. To apply, please go to my referral link: https://grnh.se/xiy346, or mention my name in the application form.

You can also email me at jchester+hn-aug18@pivotal.io if you have questions. I won't reply to copypasta. I may not be able to reply immediately, as I am just an engineer here. These help me earn a referral bonuses, which I appreciate.

Spot hero requires a coding challenge. It's not a small one either; it's like 2+ days of work. I said I had a ton of open source stuff on Github, some doing more complex stuff than their assignment and if they could just look at that.
They refused.

I no longer do pro-interview requirements for free. Maybe if I got a $300 gift card.

Please don't interview here. Don't work for free!!

This breaks the rule at the top which asks you not to reply to job posts to complain about something. We're in no position to adjudicate such complaints, nor are these threads a good place for companies to reply, or for the community to discuss or work anything out.

> nor are these threads a good place for companies to reply, or for the community to discuss or work anything out.
This keeps being repeated as if it's somehow obvious or undisputed, but it's not, nor is the actual "good place" for such a discussion ever indicated.

Previously, you've also mentioned that the rule isn't designed to be strictly fair in some way, but, generally, better for HN overall. In what way? That is, by what mechanism is it better? What downside are you trying to avoid?

Where was this dicussed and/or decided? What's the reasoning behind it? Is the decision based on facts or conjecture?

reply

	
djsumdog 10 days ago [-]

It is up there in the rules. I'm sure I've read it in the past and probably forgot about it. Now that I've been hit by it I'll remember.
But I see your point for sure. HN is heavily moderated and I've watched good discussions simply go away. I've come to accept that as just being par the course for HN.

Maybe the right forum would be GlassDoor?

> It is up there in the rules.
It wasn't always, and it's quite an exceptional standard, compared to the rest of the site.

> Maybe the right forum would be GlassDoor?

Unfortunately, Glassdoor has no facility for discussion.

Moreover, HN mods haven't come out and stated outright that this category of conversation isn't welcome anywhere on HN, though the implicit global censoriship is hard to ignore.

Los Angeles | CTO / Head of Engineering | $50k - $150k and/or 5% to 20% equity | Early Stage
High-level pitch of product Renters get 15% of their rent back, landlords get responsible long term renters.

Product Colibrin has developed a patent-pending "Renter Fund" technology which applies time-tested behavioral economic models, similar to credit card cash-back programs or airline points, to create a mutually beneficial outcome for both renters and their landlords. Renters that use Colibrin's "Renter Fund" can receive up to 15% of their cumulative rent payments back when they move out if they reside in a property for a minimum number of years. Landlords and real estate investors that use Colibrin's Renter Fund can receive higher than average returns since their properties will have lower vacancy rates, lower management fees, lower repair costs, and higher cash-flows -- resulting in a higher NOI.

Why us? We are from MIT Sloan, one of the largest real estate holding families in Beverly is in our advisory group, the family that discovered fuzzy logic at MIT is one of our investors. We have a product that can scale quickly, decentralize real estate ownership, and creates a win-win scenario for our market participants.

The other co-founder studied at UC Berkeley and MIT Sloan, has been a software developer and product manager. We already have strong interest from renters and landlords. We are at the early stage and are expecting our valuation to grow 100x in the coming years. We can provide you a dedicated office area.

Your title CTO / Head of Engineering / Co-founder

Description Lead all things software development. You will be our first co-founder.

Skills - Backend: Java and Play Framework (optional), MySQL - Frontend: HTML, Javascript, any framework - Business accumen

Salary / Equity - To start $50k per year as contractor - After 3-months and completion of first web application salary can increase to $150k per year - The company is currently valued at $2m, and you will receive 5% to 15% vested across four years.

BookMyScan | https://bookmyscan.co.uk | Cambridge / London, UK | REMOTE (Europe) | Full-time | Python/Django/PostgreSQL | Senior Full Stack Developer | £40-£50k
I am the CTO at BookMyScan, and we develop online booking systems for diagnostic scans. We have a number of exciting opportunities, and therefore need to expand the development team.

I am looking for my first developer, reporting directly to me. We are using Python, Django and PostgreSQL on the back-end, Javascript and jQuery on the front-end, all deployed on AWS. As the first developer in a start-up, you will be involved with all aspects of the development process: specification, development, testing, release, support.

Ideally, the developer would work core-hours of 10-4.30 (UK time), with a brief stand-up at 10 each day. I have grown development teams successfully in previous start-ups, but I am still open to ideas for improvements.

Interview process consists of: short coding test (should take no more than 1 hour); 30-minute remote interview; 60-minute remote or face-to-face interview, depending on location. I have hired successfully from Hacker News before.

We have ambitious plans to grow quickly in an environment where data is sensitive, so any experience of scaling, security and robustness would be helpful. Any experience of start-ups and medical information systems would also be useful, but is not essential.

Please apply by sending your C.V. to me, with a short paragraph about why you would be a good fit for the role. Feel free to contact me with any questions. paul.redman at bookmyscan etc.
