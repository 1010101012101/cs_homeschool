$100=====Nava | Infrastructure Engineers, Fullstack Software Engineers, Designers | Washington DC, San Francisco SF, New York NYC, REMOTE | On-site - Full-time | $100k-$160k+ + equity + benefits | We're a small team of engineers, designers, and product builders that were brought in to help fix Healthcare.gov in the winter of 2013. Our revamped application is used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time.
It turns out there’s a lot more to reimagine within government services, which is why we’re partnering with both the Department of Veterans Affairs and Medicare. With the VA, we are working to modernize their appeals system, making millions of veteran’s lives better through the process. Today, the average appeal takes 5 years to process; we can fix this. For Medicare, we are designing and building the architecture for Medicare's historic transition towards value-based care.
It’s surprising how much can be done by a small group of diverse, empathetic people with deep technical experience, working closely with dedicated civil servants in government. We’ve started Nava as a public benefit corporation to radically improve how our government serves its people, and we believe that the services our government provides should be clear and reliable. If you feel the same way, we'd love to hear from you.

$=====Beckman Coulter Life Sciences | JavaScript or C# Engineers | SW Oregon | Full-time | Onsite
BC makes actual hardware products.  This group makes boxes that sniff air and tell you how clean it is.  Useful for microchip makers and especially drug companies.

We’re not a startup, which means you don’t have to deal with 20-something hotshots who have something to prove, all the while writing code for products that nobody will ever want.  We don’t work 12-hour days while pretending to have unlimited personal time.  It’s a mature company that treats its employees with respect and pays them well.  And it makes actual stuff that gets built and shipped out the door.

It also wants to stay relevant with the latest technologies and needs your skills to keep up with the workload.  We have 14 openings right now.  The average employee here is probably over 35, and over a decade of service.

Salary range?  I’m getting paid more here than I ever did in California, and my annual take-home starts with a 2.  You don’t have to take a pay cut to move here.  And holy @#$% does it go far.

Imagine, living in a small city with a surprising array of big-city amenities, beautiful mountains everywhere, where almost everyone’s nice, most men wear beards, and you can afford a house with a yard on a single income.  Maybe like the town you grew up in.  We’re 4 hours from Portland, so don’t worry about getting too much of that scene unless you want to.

After grinding it out in the SF bay area dystopia for years, I felt like I’d died and gone to heaven when I took this job.  If you do well on your resume and phone screen, BC will fly you out for a daylong onsite, which is really useful if you’re on your last dime after getting sucked dry by California rents.  How about leaving that scene behind?
We want talent, and we don't get hung up on irrelevant details.  Email me at <username>@beckman.com.

You would be joining our core backend team on-site in London, working mostly with Scala and 'big data' ecosystem technologies (our full stack is below). We're happy to talk to people with a wide range of experience—from straight out of university to those with decades of experience—but you should have a genuine interest and preferably experience in FP, distributed systems, and stream processing.

Things that make us different: Profitable, infinite runway, 85%+ owned by founders and employees, no VC (we raised less than $200k 6 years ago, but have grown profitably since then), amazing 8 person full time non-technical team (Sales, Ops, Customer & Caterer acquisition, photographers), small engineering team, best in industry unit economics, very strong 5 year history of increasing revenue and profit growth, flexible and experimental view about travel & work.

Looking to hire 3 people immediately who think hard work and excellent software are the most powerful tools to dominate markets. We're particularly looking for really strong front end candidates with strong design sense.

Please email me if you're interested in the above :)

$90=====OpenMessage | Senior Software Engineers | https://openmessage.io | NYC | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE if willing to relocate to NYC | $90-$130k + 0.1-2.5%
Hello fellow engineers and future teammates,

We are making advances in the field of applied conversational experiences for messaging. Our platform implements true mixed-initiative dialog, which is not possible with stock AI frameworks or services. Being able to fuse realistic human-like conversation design ("character") and NLP/ML with the ubiquity of SMS/MMS (and RCS/Business Chat soon) is why I personally get out of bed in the morning as an engineer at OM.

It's also nice that goal-oriented conversations are like little conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you're into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our prioritization and decision making so there is a lot of interesting and impactful stuff to do there.

If you're into massive scaling and operations, we are currently humming along at hundreds of messages per second and have a roadmap to get to millions in the next few months. We need your help to get there.

For the design-inclined, one of our major features is the conversational composer frontend with previews/canvas drawing etc. that will evolve according to what the messaging channels can support in terms of content types and interaction. Messages are personalized in different ways.

We are hooking commerce functionality into the conversations as well. Buying products this way is a lot of fun as a user. Thanks to our design, we can kick off any kind of API calls as a natural part of the conversation without adding complexity to the codebase.

Our current tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker. We are exploring Go for some things and prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles. Creativity is best applied to data structures and decoupling.

We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy as well. No jerks or brogrammers, but freaks and geeks are always welcome!

There is a small code challenge that checks for data manipulation techniques. No silly puzzles or whiteboarding. Existing open source code can be submitted as an alternative if applicable.
Email me at chris@openmessage.io to set up a call. Thanks!

$2=====BitMEX | San Francisco | On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.

Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!

Membership starts at $79/year and members generally save ~40% on any purchase. Taxes on cannabis are as high as 38% in certain areas, so by lowering product prices, consumers save a lot of money on taxes too.

We're only 6 months old but we are scaling fast. We have 20 billboards up in SF this month and will be expanding across the state within the next 6-12 months.

  - You will receive a fair, proactive raise bi-annually, without you needing to ask.  
  - You will have the option (not required) to travel with the team domestically and internationally multiple times a year -- spouses and kids welcome (and paid for).  
  - You will be provided the best equipment, a personal mentor committed to your success, tools to encourage a healthy work/life balance, and a workplace that is safe, respectful, collaborative, and inspiring.
  - You will be truly welcome regardless of age, race, gender, orientation, or other affiliation.

Some of the cool things we're working on:

  - Concierge, a “supervised learning” AI-powered customer support platform
  - BedrockDB.com, an open-source, blockchain-based SQL database atop SQLite
  - SmartScan, an OCR/human receipt transcription service
  - Next day ACH processing many millions of dollars daily
  - Scaling realtime search across 30 days (16TB) of system logs

$375=====Parse.ly | Growth & Data Lead | Remote | Fully Distributed Team | https://parse.ly
Parse.ly is the web's attention engine. As a measurement layer running across the web, Parse.ly quantifies how visitors respond to online content. Our products are then used by the web's biggest brands and publishers to understand audience attention across the internet in real-time. Our flagship product is Parse.ly Analytics (https://parse.ly/analytics), and is already used by over 400 enterprise customers (https://parse.ly/customers).

But, Parse.ly is just getting started. We just launched Parse.ly Currents (https://parse.ly/currents), a new product that helps people understand internet-wide trends and how content/attention flows online.

As the Growth & Data Lead for Parse.ly, you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, and you want to take a B2B software company out of its successful niche and across the chasm into the broader market. You are comfortable with remote & fully distributed teams. To excel here, you'll work with designers and web developers as collaborators, and be able to leverage data-oriented growth marketing strategies, such as launching search engine optimized public products built atop Parse.ly's data, or important sharing features in our existing sites and products.

You are the kind of person who'd enjoy the books "Hacking Growth", "Traction", "Four Steps to the Epiphany", and "High Growth Handbook". For bonus points, you also care about SaaS enterprise sales. For example, you are the kind of person who enjoyed Dan Pink’s "To Sell is Human".

In this role, you'd run a small team of designers and developers that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s public website, technical documentation, knowledge base, emails/newsletters, data studies, and blog. You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to any of these projects, with a goal of growing sign-ups (and customers) for these products. From a technical standpoint, you'll be data savvy, know some SQL, and be comfortable working with designers/developers, who themselves are comfortable with a modern JavaScript and Python development stack. You'll also use analytics tools like Google Analytics, MixPanel and yes, even, Parse.ly itself, to understand engagement of our visitors, and to position us for more growth in new channels like organic search, social sharing, data-driven press, and free (self-service) data products.

If you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, this job is for you. If you are a former startup founder seeking to relocate to an established startup, but want to continue the path of deploying lean growth techniques, this role may be especially suited for you.

Apply here:

Email work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/projects you think may be relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile. Make sure to mention HN and the "Growth & Data Lead" role. Also, please list your timezone, working hours, and location. Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US/Eastern timezone, due to the timezone makeup of this team.
^ A note on our fully distributed team. The mission of our lean distributed team is described here: https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission. We happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. We expect you to be comfortable with this setup, and collaborating with people primarily over Zoom/GMeet, GitHub, Slack, and email. The cool thing is, this lets you set up your ideal work environment; here's a photograph of mine running two full-screen Parse.ly Analytics dashboards on my monitors: https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73.
