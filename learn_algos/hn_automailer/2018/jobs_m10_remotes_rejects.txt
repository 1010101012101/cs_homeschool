As we are a distributed organization, at least 50% travel is expected. Recruiting is being conducted broadly across all technical stacks. If you are a great developer and eager to learn new technologies or platforms, we want to talk to you.

Example projects include: developing blockchain based inventory control systems, tracking biological pathogens, reinventing an organization's recruiting platform and process, developing massive IoT telemetry ingestion platforms, and building media delivery platforms for some of the biggest sporting events in the world.

ago [-]Command E | Lead Engineer (#1) | San Francisco, CA | Onsite/Remote | Full Time
We're building a next-generation search tool, and we're hiring employee #1—a lead engineer who wants to get in at the ground floor (pre-seed/seed stage). Both co-founders are engineers who worked at First Round Capital, Eventbrite, and Digg. We worked together at a top VC firm for 3 years and have a healthy mix of engineering skills + business sense. We’re looking for a unique engineer who is persistent, exploratory, multi-disciplinary, and demonstrates leadership.

Command E helps provides effortless, lightning-fast navigation of your chaotic workspace. Command E lets you instantly search your cloud data (i.e. Google Drive, Salesforce, Trello/Asana, Dropbox/Box, wikis, and more). We’re bringing the “fuzzy finder” file-switching experience of vi/Emacs/IDEs to business people. Our unique technology searches across many cloud providers and displays results as you type, in less than 10ms.

Our stack is Electron/React/Redux/SQLite. We’re using ES6, async/await, Promises, and all the cool new JavaScript stuff, but the search index is backed by rock-solid native SQLite/C++. From a technical perspective there's tons of fun space to explore—high-performance full-text search indexing, fast async UIs, modern dev frameworks, encryption, or deploying cross-platform desktop apps.

We're at 3rd & Market in San Francisco and have legendary VC/angel investors. We met each other 4 years ago through a "Who's Hiring?” thread, so we're excited to see who responds to this one!
There isn't much publicly available about us yet, but email benstandefer at gmail dot com and I'll share all the details.

ago [-]Engineer #1 | Stealth stage analytics company | NYC/Remote
Stealth stage analytics company is looking to bring on Engineer #1. I’ve bootstrapped this business over the last two years and just hit a $1MM run rate.

This is a hands-on role and will allow you to basically own the technology stack and build out the technology team.

A few of the projects you’ll be leading:

- A streaming data pipeline on Kafka handling millions of events a day.

- An open source data integration library that connects data to/from over 75+ of the most common data sources companies rely upon

-A scheduler that deploys thousands of containers a day into Kubernetes clusters, efficiently migrating our customers’ data between systems.

- An open source JavaScript event tracking library

The technology stack is mostly JVM (Java and Scala) with some Python and ES6/React/Redux on the frontend. Everything is containerized and runs on Heroku and Kubernetes.

Candidates should have a mastery of at least one language, and ideally have experience with the following: Docker/Kubernetes, SQL, Kafka, JavaScript, data warehouses (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery), ETL, data pipelines. Bonus points if you have experience managing engineering teams.

This is a very early position so compensation can be whatever blend of salary/equity you prefer.
Send me an email at slapshothn@gmail.com with a bit about who you are and what you’ve built. If I think there’s a fit, I’ll schedule a Skype/Hangout with you and tell you about the business and discuss the role in more depth.

ago [-]Namebase | Frontend Engineer | San Francisco | REMOTE | ONSITE
Namebase is a top-level domain registrar and exchange for the Handshake blockchain. Namebase makes it easy for anyone to buy/sell Handshake coins (HNS) and use their HNS to register TLDs.-- Why should you care?
The internet wasn't built to handle the scale it supports today. The DNS we rely on is supported by ducktape solutions that fail to serve the security and reliability needs of today's internet. For instance, compromised Certificate Authorities threaten SSL (https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/certificate-authority-vulner...), and domains get seized for arbitrary reasons, even for good actors (https://twitter.com/zoho/status/1044249648993525760?s=20).
Handshake fixes these issues by letting anyone register secure, censorship-resistant TLDs on the blockchain. More details can be found in the whitepaper https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt.

Namebase is driving adoption of Handshake's DNS by making it easier to use and more powerful.

We are looking for an experienced frontend engineer to join our team of 4 including 2 engineers.

We don't require experience with our tech stack, just the motivation and ability to learn. For more details on the role, email me and I'd love to tell you more - Tieshun, tieshun at namebase.io, Namebase CEO

Storj develops an open-source, decentralized cloud storage platform called Storj (pronounced storage) that is disrupting the cloud storage market. Rather than storing files in a data center, Storj works by encrypting and partitioning files, then sending the shards to a network of devices contributed by our global community—with active storage nodes on every continent except Antarctica. We rent unused hard drive space from users all over the globe, operating active storage nodes on every continent (except Antarctica). Our core target is selling to software developers and channel partners who get higher quality, privacy, and security at 1/6th the price. We are laying the groundwork for the future of decentralization and web 3.0.

Headquartered in Atlanta, Storj is a global company with North American employees in California, Washington, Utah, Michigan, and Georgia, and European employees in Germany and Bulgaria.

Most of our engineering team sits in Atlanta, where the company was founded. We're in the Atlanta Tech Village, Buckhead. The bulk of our marketing team is in our downtown Salt Lake City office at the Impact Hub co-office building located at 150 S. State Street.

* Experience with embedded Linux (yocto)

* Modern C++ (C++11, C++14, C++17)

ago [-]Plaid | Software Engineer | SF, SLC, or REMOTE | equity + benefits | REMOTE, Full-time, https://plaid.com/
Hi HN! I'm James Nichols, an engineering manager at Plaid. We're hiring, and I believe that for the right people, a position at Plaid could be truly transformational. I was a member of Microsoft's Bing team back when it was MSN Search (2006!) and was at Airbnb before it was a household name, but I've never been more excited than I am now in my new role at Plaid. I joined Plaid because of the Plaids I met and because of the feeling I had that I had discovered a secret: a really amazing company, well-positioned in an exciting space, that wasn't well known among my friends.

Interestingly, only my friends in fintech had familiarity. "Plaid? Oh they're great!" was a common refrain. As I learned more, I realized that Plaid was actually a major part of some of my favorite apps (https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/meet-the-startup-that-powers...). Venmo, Robinhood, Lending Club, Coinbase, Square Cash, Acorns, and Plastic all use Plaid's APIs to improve the user experience of connecting to the banking system. 2018 has been a big year for Plaid (and the fintech space in general), and the company has huge plans in 2019 to deliver even more consumer value, to expand dramatically, and to do it all while cultivating a company culture (and hiring bar) to be proud of.

The vast majority of the company is based in San Francisco, but the newly opened Salt Lake City office has a small, tight team that’s growing fast, led by Kira Booth (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kira-booth-11aab289/). The SLC office (in the growing tech scene of “Silicon Slopes”) is a short drive from world-class skiing and national parks.  Plaid also has a team of remote, location-independent, highly successful engineers. The company is doubling down on this, as evidenced by hiring me as their first remote engineering manager. I'll be remote myself, and focused on building a world-class work environment for remote engineers who want to be part of a hypergrowth Silicon Valley company but work from anywhere they want.

Does any of this sound good? Learn more at https://plaid.com/company/ and reach out to me by email (my first name at plaid.com) with a little bit about yourself. Let me know which one of these statements resonates the most:
- You're excited about the fintech space but would prefer to empower hundreds of consumer applications rather than just a single one.
- You want to join a hypergrowth company, especially before everyone else finds out about it.
- You care a lot about company culture and the people you work with, but impact is your primary motivation to do great work.
- You’re based in Salt Lake City and excited at the prospect of a growing SLC office of a Silicon Valley company.
- You've considered becoming a remote engineer, but are worried that you'll have to sacrifice career growth, technical challenge, culture, or other important parts of your work environment.
- You're already a very effective remote engineer and interested in collaborating with a team invested in remote work.

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post here or not - we aren't a recruiting firm or job board. We are a home for freelancers/contractors and we have several openings.

Facet Development is a freelancer network made up exclusively of ex-FAANG engineers. Facet does the work of finding freelancing jobs/projects and then we send them out to the devs in the network. We also provide project management and billing/collections, help with taxes, etc, so freelancers get to spend a lot more of their time doing the enjoyable parts of freelancing and not trying to run a small business.

We target FAANG companies and companies that wish they could hire FAANG devs when finding work for our freelancer network. When I was a dev lead at Microsoft, bringing on vendors or outsourcing was a terrible experience, because they always seemed to be below our hiring bar. So I started Facet to solve the problem I had when I was an engineering manager at a FAANG company.

If you are a FAANG or ex-FAANG dev that wants to switch to freelancing or already is, you should join: https://www.facetdev.com/developer-network

Web Developers / Full Stack Developers / News Algorithm Developers / Back End Software Engineers | NewsNow.co.uk | 100% remote (UK residents only) | Full-time, permanent
We are a top ten UK media publisher, with a website loved by millions: a technology company at heart with industry-leading success metrics propelled by a highly experienced multi-disciplinary engineering team that can afford to run lean. Which means today, we offer all the excitement and agility of a start-up, but with the stability and benefits of an established business — we’re still a company where everyone gets to make a massive impact!

Our mission: to democratise and disrupt the market for news. Today, we have major plans for growth, both here in the UK and abroad, and to create even more social capital out of what has been an extremely successful platform: through increased editorial direction, curating credible but independent journalism, as well as through computational approaches to identifying the best news to show our users.

We currently have these opportunities:

- As a /Designer/Developer/, you’ll be responsible for designing all aspects of the website UI and brand, and work closely with Head of Digital Product and senior management on the biggest redesign of our homepage in 20 years. You will be working with Adobe Creative Suite, JavaScript/Node/React, CSS3/SASS, HTML5, Responsive Web Design, progressive enhancement and feature detection.

- As a /Fully Remote Web Developer/, you’ll write the logic that drives the UI, and integrate new UI with back-end data. You’ll also work on a wide array of other UI/UX, SEO, and content integration challenges.

- As a /Fully Remote Full Stack Developer/, you’ll be expected to contribute authoritatively towards product development projects throughout the entire software stack: from database and infrastructure installation and configuration, through writing business logic and prototyping website presentation, to developing our bespoke programmatic advertising technologies.

- As a /Fully Remote News Algorithm Developer/, you’ll develop automated curation algorithms that will produce the content for a new homepage format.

- As a /Fully Remote Back End Software Engineer/, your projects will largely be server-side. You will bring a sophisticated approach to problem solving, finding ways to achieve objectives while addressing scalability challenges and security concerns.
All London positions are based at our centrally-located head office.
All fully remote roles are open to UK residents only.If you think you’re a fit for any of these roles, please apply online. http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/careers/

https://www.tanium.com/careers/?gh_src=qprker8f1

Tanium's product is basically computer security & management software for government and large enterprises. It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the "Usain Bolt of cyber­security" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].

The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is "game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes." [3]

Tanium has a strong engineering culture and takes really good care of it's employees. E.g. team gatherings (3~4/year) leave Monday and Friday open for travel rather than taking half your weekend.

Fortune featured us as one of the Best Small and Medium Workplaces [4], partially based on the Great Place to Work survey, which gave us top marks for challenges, atmosphere, rewards, pride, and communication [5].

Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.

Compensation is near FAANG levels with base, bonus, and RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.

We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.

Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].

Senior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React). There's also growing amounts of Python, particularly for endpoint scripting, and a tiny bit of Rust.


On site or US Remote (pick the closest one) - SF: https://grnh.se/ixfioowp1 | RTP: https://grnh.se/bxio4pg51

Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.

(Note: "Director" is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)
