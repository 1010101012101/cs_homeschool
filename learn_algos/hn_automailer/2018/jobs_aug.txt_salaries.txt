$33=====Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineers; Product Managers; Data Scientists | San Francisco, CA | Onsite
Academia.edu is addressing two problems:

- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.

- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.

It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as "the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.

With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.

With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community.

Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.

We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes "We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world."

We are looking to hire full stack software engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.

Southeast USA including: Virginia (Arlington and Dulles), Maryland (Annapolis Junction), South Carolina (Greenville), Alabama (Huntsville), Florida (beach east of Melbourne), Texas (Austin and San Antonio), Pennsylvania (State College) and possibly others, all ONSITE. Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly. We write our own low-level tools, frequently in C99 to run on Linux. We also use IDA Pro, qemu, Simics, JTAG debuggers, gdb, Coverity, KlocWork, LLVM, and so on. Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers.

Common degrees include Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics.

We don't normally work overtime, and we get paid more if we do. We're never expected to take work home or be on call. Because of the citizenship requirement, there is no chance that the work will be outsourced. Flex-time is fairly extreme; some do randomish hours.

$900=====Contract Simply (YC S17) | Austin, TX | Product Manager | Full-Time | Onsite
Contract Simply (https://contractsimply.com) is looking for a Senior Product Manager in Austin or is willing to relocate.

ABOUT US

Contract Simply is building the first A.I., machine learning platform for the $900B US construction lending market. We help banks manage their large and complex construction loan portfolio using intelligent automation and integrated payments. Unlike a typical loan, a construction loan isn’t a single payment. Instead, it’s broken up into monthly payments called draws. That monthly draw process is complicated, with many stakeholders and hundreds or thousands of documents. Currently, all of this is managed with excel spreadsheets, PDFs, emails, and paper checks.

Our software helps lenders, developers, and other stakeholders produce and process this documentation automatically, leading to fewer errors, faster payments, and more profitable loans.

We’re currently small (10 employees), YC-backed, and are already working with several of the largest lenders in the industry. You’d be working directly with the founders in a company that values being purposeful, efficient, authentic, transparent, curious, and agile.

ABOUT YOU / THE ROLE

We’re looking for a product manager who is happy to take ownership of the product lifecycle and who is not afraid to get their hands dirty. Your key responsibilities will be to set the medium-term vision and strategy of the product and communicate that strategy to all of the relevant participants and stakeholders.

We offer competitive pay and benefits, plus equity. Our culture is open, transparent, and fun. We work hard, but also take time for our families, friends, and hobbies.

If you're interested, please contact me at andrew@contractsimply.com. You can also read more about the job and requirements at https://angel.co/contract-simply/jobs/322111-sr-product-mana...

$50=====Los Angeles | CTO / Head of Engineering | $50k - $150k and/or 5% to 20% equity | Early Stage
High-level pitch of product Renters get 15% of their rent back, landlords get responsible long term renters.

Product Colibrin has developed a patent-pending "Renter Fund" technology which applies time-tested behavioral economic models, similar to credit card cash-back programs or airline points, to create a mutually beneficial outcome for both renters and their landlords. Renters that use Colibrin's "Renter Fund" can receive up to 15% of their cumulative rent payments back when they move out if they reside in a property for a minimum number of years. Landlords and real estate investors that use Colibrin's Renter Fund can receive higher than average returns since their properties will have lower vacancy rates, lower management fees, lower repair costs, and higher cash-flows -- resulting in a higher NOI.

Why us? We are from MIT Sloan, one of the largest real estate holding families in Beverly is in our advisory group, the family that discovered fuzzy logic at MIT is one of our investors. We have a product that can scale quickly, decentralize real estate ownership, and creates a win-win scenario for our market participants.

The other co-founder studied at UC Berkeley and MIT Sloan, has been a software developer and product manager. We already have strong interest from renters and landlords. We are at the early stage and are expecting our valuation to grow 100x in the coming years. We can provide you a dedicated office area.

Your title CTO / Head of Engineering / Co-founder

Description Lead all things software development. You will be our first co-founder.

Skills - Backend: Java and Play Framework (optional), MySQL - Frontend: HTML, Javascript, any framework - Business accumen

Salary / Equity - To start $50k per year as contractor - After 3-months and completion of first web application salary can increase to $150k per year - The company is currently valued at $2m, and you will receive 5% to 15% vested across four years.

Spot hero requires a coding challenge. It's not a small one either; it's like 2+ days of work. I said I had a ton of open source stuff on Github, some doing more complex stuff than their assignment and if they could just look at that.
They refused.

$50=====Los Angeles | CTO / Head of Engineering | $50k - $150k and/or 5% to 20% equity | Early Stage
High-level pitch of product Renters get 15% of their rent back, landlords get responsible long term renters.

Product Colibrin has developed a patent-pending "Renter Fund" technology which applies time-tested behavioral economic models, similar to credit card cash-back programs or airline points, to create a mutually beneficial outcome for both renters and their landlords. Renters that use Colibrin's "Renter Fund" can receive up to 15% of their cumulative rent payments back when they move out if they reside in a property for a minimum number of years. Landlords and real estate investors that use Colibrin's Renter Fund can receive higher than average returns since their properties will have lower vacancy rates, lower management fees, lower repair costs, and higher cash-flows -- resulting in a higher NOI.

Why us? We are from MIT Sloan, one of the largest real estate holding families in Beverly is in our advisory group, the family that discovered fuzzy logic at MIT is one of our investors. We have a product that can scale quickly, decentralize real estate ownership, and creates a win-win scenario for our market participants.

The other co-founder studied at UC Berkeley and MIT Sloan, has been a software developer and product manager. We already have strong interest from renters and landlords. We are at the early stage and are expecting our valuation to grow 100x in the coming years. We can provide you a dedicated office area.

Your title CTO / Head of Engineering / Co-founder

Description Lead all things software development. You will be our first co-founder.

Skills - Backend: Java and Play Framework (optional), MySQL - Frontend: HTML, Javascript, any framework - Business accumen
