This is going to be a labour of love for someone–this pay rate is not at all competitive for Toronto. That said, I'd love to do it if I had the skills! It sounds like a really awesome project.

The Company

Over the past year, we’ve worked hard to build an exceptional team, raise over $30 million in funding, and provide homes for dozens of families, meaningfully changing their financial future. Our customers choose any home for sale, and Divvy buys it on their behalf.

Our customers get to live in their future home today, while buying fractions of the home over time.

The Job

We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer passionate about using their creativity and talent to make access to homeownership more accessible. In this role, you’ll be part of the engineering team building our consumer, agent and administrative products.

We're spearheading the movement that allows you to scale up your application on any cloud at any time and have fun doing it. We happen to be scaling up ourselves at a rapid rate and are looking for like-minded individuals who love the fast-paced nature of startups where you can make a huge impact in the early stages of a great idea.
We recently announced our $10 million A-round backed by some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/30/serverless-inc-lands-10-m-...

And our new product: Serverless Platform https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-platform-beta-helps-t...

We offer full benefits, 401(k), biannual team retreats in places like Austria, Morocco, and Northern California, flexible work schedule and unlimited PTO. And, of course, there's our office dog, Bumper (https://www.instagram.com/bumperdoodle/).

Spot hero requires a coding challenge. It's not a small one either; it's like 2+ days of work. I said I had a ton of open source stuff on Github, some doing more complex stuff than their assignment and if they could just look at that.
They refused.

I no longer do pro-interview requirements for free. Maybe if I got a $300 gift card.

Please don't interview here. Don't work for free!!
