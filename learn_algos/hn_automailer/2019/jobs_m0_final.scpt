I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM. I also recieved a scholarship from the EF to attend Devcon IV this year.

I have experience with frontend, backend, python, go, ethereum, javascript, react, mobile and noticed them in the post.
I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM. I also recieved a scholarship from the EF to attend Devcon IV this year.

I have experience with frontend and noticed them in the post.
I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won a prize at Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum. I've also helped organize and run workshops at a ethereum developer meetup and worked on hyperledger projects within IBM. I also recieved a scholarship from the EF to attend Devcon IV this year.
