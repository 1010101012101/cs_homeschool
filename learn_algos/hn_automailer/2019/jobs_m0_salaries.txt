$50=====ago [-]Fullstack.io | Book author | Remote | Part Time | https://www.fullstack.io/write-a-book/
Earn on order of $50k/year by writing a programming book. We’re the authors of Fullstack React, ng-book, Fullstack Vue and we’re looking to work with authors like you to write a few new books this year.
Our books sell very well because:

- We go way beyond API docs and teach everything you need to know to build real apps.

- We guarantee the books and code are up to date.

- We invest in marketing the books (and have an active email list of over 100k)

- We love the topics we write about and aim to create something remarkable every time.

If you decided to self-publish, you may find the marketing is more than writing the book. We have an audience, and we know what they want to read - so when your book is done, we already have people who want to buy it.

If you decide to go with a “traditional” publisher, you may be given a mediocre editor, write your book in MS Word (ha), and earn 5-15% in royalties. With us, our editors (me) are programmers first, our tooling is dev-friendly, and our royalties are split 50/50. (For scale, the author of Fullstack Vue earned $20k on the opening weekend.)

I’d specifically like to work with someone on Fullstack Go and Fullstack Rust - which is less about the respective languages and more like guides to building full-stack web applications with each, including third-party libraries, etc. But we’re also looking to write content about Python, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Elixir, etc. Anything up and coming.

If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, fill out the form linked below. Looking forward to hearing from you!

$70=====ago [-]QuotaPath | Backend, Frontend or Full-stack Engineer | Philadelphia, PA or Austin, TX | $70K to $140K DOE | Full-Time | On-Site | https://www.quotapath.com/careers/
Happy new year, y’all!

Sales compensation plans can be shockingly complex. Too often, salespeople are forced to use unfriendly accounting software or to pass around buggy Excel spreadsheets. At QuotaPath, we’re solving this problem in a new way by creating a platform that’s built for salespeople, not accountants. Our business model is unique, both consumer-facing and B2B (“B2BC”; think Slack). Good UX and beautiful design are at the core of our process. The demand for a product like this is intense and we’re working as hard as we can to deliver features to eager users.

We’re looking for engineers to help us accelerate our development. If you’re interested in having a huge impact on a small team, this is a great opportunity. We’re well-funded, but we’re still only 8 people: 3 engineers, 1 UX and 4 others. I’m one of those 3 engineers, and I’m also the technical co-founder. Please ask me questions if you have any!

Our stack is Python + Django on the backend, TypeScript + React on the frontend, but we’re more interested in working with people who are smart and capable than people from any particular background. If you have strong opinions about using different tech, we’ll hear you. Like most startups, we’re built on lots of open source tech and we plan on giving back. We value building a culture of inclusion and transparency. We care about diversity and hope you do too.

Citizenship is a job requirement.
We do emulators, JIT, hypervisors, stuff similar to valgrind, debuggers, manual disassembly, binary static analysis, parsers, and assembly.

Easily transferable skills include those related to compilers, kernel drivers, embedded RTOSes, vectorizing, firmware, VxWorks BSP development, symbolic execution, boot loaders, software verification, concolic testing, abstract interpretation, satisfiability (SAT, SMT) solvers, and decompilers.

$2=====ago [-]BitMEX | SF |Sr Security/K8S/Node/API | On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.
Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!

$160=====ago [-]Thanx | SF, DEN, Remote | Principal Engineer | ONSITE/REMOTE, Full-time | $160-$200K | https://boards.greenhouse.io/thanx/jobs/903207
Americans spend more than $5 trillion on restaurants, retail, and services each year. Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.
Thanx is fundamentally changing that. Thanx personalizes every interaction between a merchant and their best customers, resulting in measurable increases in revenue for merchants and far greater personalization for consumers. How?
•	Through proprietary partnerships with credit card networks (e.g. Visa, Mastercard, Amex), Thanx can reward consumers for their purchases and deliver highly-customized promotions
•	Through our interactive dashboard, Thanx makes even the smallest marketing team a data-science driven expert in personalization - right message to the right customer at the right time through the right channel.
•	By measuring our success based on revenue generated (not opens and clicks of emails)
Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail. Thanx is backed by some of the best investors in the world — Sequoia Capital, Icon Ventures, and Andy Rachleff (CEO Wealthfront, cofounder Benchmark Capital).
Thanx Engineering
•	Team: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from successful product companies like Disney, Google, and Facebook. This is an elite engineering team, period.
•	Growth: 10x YOY data growth; $100M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform -- adopted Golang, Elasticsearch, NLP, React, React Native, GraphQL, and added 5+ new microservices; all in the last 12 months. And we are just getting started.
•	Culture: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration & shared responsibility, testing and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours and PTO policy. We work and play hard -- be warned, when it comes to Mario Kart, we are super competitive!

$2=====ago [-]Clarisights | Frontend, Backend, Data engineers | Bangalore, India | Full-Time | ONSITE | https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs | 8L - 30L
Clarisights is an data ingestion and analytics platform that enables marketers to make sense of and gain unique insights from data coming in from all the sources (analytics, ads data, CRM, Payroll, etc). Our platform is a seamless in browser experience - the users just add the data sources they want to track, our backend then pulls in data from those resources and stores it into our own database. The user then proceeds to the visualisation page to create the required data visualisations.

Clarisights was founded to empower performance marketing and growth teams by creating a platform that gives them insights and superhero powers they have always wanted. Rather than wrestling with outdated spreadsheets and BI platforms that can't keep pace with their growing volume of marketing channels and data, marketers can use Clarisights to independently explore and analyse all their data in a single and intuitive interface. Marketing teams around the world use Clarisights for every aspect of their performance marketing workflow - from integrating with data channels, creating and optimising dashboards, and collaborating with teammates - all in real time!

We have found product market fit and have recently closed a $2M round from top European VC's. Currently a team of 20 people looking to scale.

We're looking for frontend, backend and data engineers at all levels (Architects, senior, mid-level and interns). https://angel.co/clarisights/jobs

We deal with a lot of data and need real-time responses - you will have an opportunity to work on some really hard engineering problems. We often run into performance issues in popular open source tools and libraries - we don't hesitate to find the bottlenecks and fix them. Team is lead by Ex-Google and Ex-Facebook folks who've got lots of experience building scalable production software.

Tech stack :

Backend : PostGres, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, Ruby on Rails (we're considering a migration to Elixir or GoLang). Hosted on Google cloud platform.

$180=====ago [-]Clover | Sunnyvale, CA | ONSITE | Full-Time | Senior Software Engineer (Backend) | USD $180k+
Our Team

We are a small team of experienced software engineers tasked with ensuring that Clover’s rapid growth is sustainable over the long term. Our team solves for cross-cutting non-functional requirements like the security, scalability, and fault tolerance of Clover’s backend services. Together we design and develop the core architectural components, libraries, frameworks, tooling, and distributed systems at the heart of our global payment platform.

Our Work

We recently completed a project to horizontally shard our OLTP cluster, which had grown to 10+ TB in size. Next up is building a fully autonomous service for rebalancing merchant data across the shards to distribute load and eliminate hot spots.

We just finished moving our production infrastructure from private data centers to the public cloud in an effort to streamline our global expansion. Now we’re revisiting our architecture, processes, and tooling in order to better take advantage of the cloud environment.

We are actively working on the design, development, and deployment of data pipeline infrastructure to support richer analytics and reporting for our merchants and internal business needs. Our focus is on its security, scalability, reliability, and performance.

We already have a comprehensive suite of functional unit and integration tests, and are now focused on improving our automated stress tests and supporting infrastructure. That involves building the tools to spin up full production-scale environments, synthesize load, perform fault injection, and to collect, analyze, and surface test results to help drive continual improvement of performance and availability.

Our Stack


  - Java for backend services.
  - Python for integration and stress tests.
  - MySQL for OLTP. Snowflake for OLAP.
  - Kafka for stream processing.
  - Memcached for caching (duh).
  - Redis for ephemeral shared data structures.
  - Wavefront and ELK for operational visibility.
  - Google (GCP) as our cloud service provider.
  - Docker for building containers. Kubernetes for running them.
  - Netty for speaking HTTP, behind HAProxy for load balancing.

This is the Clover of today. You can help shape the Clover of tomorrow.

$2=====ago [-]BitMEX | SF |Sr Security, K8S, API/Node |On-Site | Full-Time | Visa
The Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange (BitMEX) is the world’s most advanced Bitcoin derivatives platform and the 26th largest exchange, of any type, on Earth. We have a hundred thousand active customers across the globe, particularly in Asia.
Developed by ex-bankers well-versed in computer science, financial engineering, and traditional finance, BitMEX launched in 2014. We’re new (but so is everybody in this industry) and we’ve been humbled by our success so far.

Our innovative, secure, and very liquid platform currently trades between $2 and $5 billion USD a day of crypto derivatives (futures and options only; we are not a spot exchange where you can buy Bitcoin with USD or other fiat currencies).

By offering the crypto-sphere’s greatest price discovery marketplace, BitMEX also expects, over the long term, to spur Bitcoin adoption by consumers and merchants.

Culturally, BitMEX defies the stereotypes of both the old-fashioned, testosterone-drenched Wall Street “boys club” type of firm, as well as the politically correct, “snowflake-coddling” Silicon Valley tech outfit. In truth, we are pioneering a new model of corporate culture, and learning as we go.

For example, as Angelina Kwan, chief operating officer of BitMEX, put it: “In addition to being a true market leader among trading platforms, BitMEX shares my values of gender inclusion, particularly in STEM fields. Cryptocurrency markets present an exciting new opportunity for women to get involved in the intersection of finance and technology.”

All BitMEX employees have at least three things in common: they buy into our core values unequivocally, they are effective in their roles, and they own up to their actions. No workplace is free of internal politics, but we are as much of a meritocracy as you’ll find in this cruel world. And you can be almost anything you want to be at BitMEX as long as you make your mark with your work.

If you like what you've read, visit bitmex.com/careers or email people@bitmex.com. We are hiring across all departments but our most pressing needs right now are for Node/API Engineers, Senior SREs and Kubernetes Engineers.
We look forward to hearing from you!
