I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist.

I came across your post on Hacker News and wanted to inquire if you were still interviewing for any FT SE roles.
I have experience with blockchain, javascript, react  and noticed them in the post.
I’ve been following blockchain projects like ethereum, dash, ripple, bitcoin etc for a while and have read many whitepapers. I worked on a prototype ethereum ui before mist. More recently I won at a hackathon nearby, Ethwaterloo for prototyping an identity management / social network layer protocol for ethereum.

Are you still interviewing candidates?  And do you think I'd be a good fit for this or anything else you're looking for?
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Thanks,
