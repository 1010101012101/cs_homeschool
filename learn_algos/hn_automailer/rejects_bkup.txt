CourseHero (https://coursehero.com) | Redwood City, CA | ONSITE | Full-time | NLP Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer
Course Hero is changing education by building a global community of students, the largest digital library of study materials, and innovative machine learning technology to support both learning and teaching.
Our engineering teams release code every day to millions of people, so we're looking for someone who can embrace challenges, build new features, and iterate quickly. Our projects are big ­­- many terabytes of data and millions of users around the world - ­­but our team is small, so you’ll see projects from start to finish and work closely with product managers and designers to ensure successful results.
We are looking for a Staff/Senior Machine learning engineer who can hit the ground running and work on a lot of fun (and challenging) projects that range from recommending relevant content to our users to extracting question/answer pair from documents. You’ll be a part of the engineering team at Course hero and will ship products that are used by millions of users. We are a data driven company and we are looking to disrupt the field of education and help millions of students learn more effectively by leveraging machine learning and AI. We are looking for people with experience in building machine learning pipelines and algorithms, expert coding skills in python, scala or an equivalent language. We deal with a lot of documents (text data), so relevant experience with Natural language processing is preferred.
Reach out to vaidy at coursehero if you are interested and mention HN in the subject!

Join the Studio team at Netflix. We are a relatively new team within Netflix, working on tools that help us create new Netflix Originals.
The Studio Production Engineering team believes content creators should be focused on creating content, not on the bureaucracy of managing a studio. We believe if we succeed, better content will be created, we will produce more Stranger Things & Master of Nones, and we will bring more joy and awareness to the world through creators.
We build tools for the Studio teams in LA, as well as for non-Netflix employees that are on-set creating our content. (We're currently piloting a new tool on the set of Glow for example).
We're looking for full-stack (Ruby on Rails and EmberJS), completely back-end (Ruby on Rails or Java), and completely front-end (Ember JS or React).
Apply here: https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/864893 or reach out to me (#{my_hn_username}@netflix.com) about the Java and React opportunities, and I'll put you in touch with the right people.
* Note: all of the "ors" in the frameworks that we use relate to specific teams within Studio Engineering.

Enigma | New York, NY | https://www.enigma.com/
We're a Series B company based in New York City and backed by NEA Ventures, Two Sigma Investments, Comcast and American Express. Enigma was founded in 2012 in order to centralize and normalize public data globally (think Google for public data).
Our view is that public data reflects more of our everyday lives than most of us realize. It’s everywhere, from a plane taking off from an airport to a barrel of crude oil flowing through a pipeline to a new drug being approved. These things exist in specific and separate public datasets, but together, they can provide a vast and powerful view of what’s happening in the world.
https://www.enigma.com/
https://www.enigma.com/labs
Today, we’ve grown into an operational data management and intelligence company that uses public data to inform and train each of our products. Our mission is to empower people to interpret and improve, the world around them. We believe in curiosity and the power of discovery.

CLOUDERA| US & Global | Engineering, G&A, Sales & More| Onsite | Full-time | https://goo.gl/5zCuS2
CLOUDERA BACKGROUND: We generate vastly more data today than ever before. There are, by IDC estimates, 4.4 zettabytes, or 4,400,000,000 terabytes, of data in the world today. That number is so big, it’s hard to comprehend. It’s the equivalent of 600 million years of high-definition video, for example. And 90% of that data has been created in just the past two years. Four years from now, experts predict there will be ten times as much -- 44 zettabytes.
This explosion of data comes from the 6.4 billion devices connected to the internet, and that number will grow nearly five-fold in the next four years. Some of those devices are computers, of course, handling sales at supermarkets, trading stocks on Wall Street, or reading DNA sequences for researchers at pharmaceutical companies. Some, though, are sensors in elevators, cars, on factory lines and in oil wells. Some are connected to people, tracking temperature and heart rate and more.
Computing is so cheap, and networks are so ubiquitous, that it’s possible now to instrument and measure almost anything we care about.
Cloudera was founded in 2008 to help businesses capture, store and analyze that data. Half of our original founders are still at the helm. We built a software platform that can handle the huge amounts of data now available. We developed a powerful collection of processing and analytic capabilities. Our customers are able to ask very deep questions of their data, and get their answers quickly.
WHY CLOUDERA? Cloudera is the largest single contributor to the Apache Hadoop project and we have trained more Hadoop engineers than any other organization on Earth.
Amazing people - We are a fun & smart team,including many of the top luminaries in Hadoop and related open source communities. We frequently interact with the research community, collaborate with engineers at other top companies & host cutting edge researchers for tech talks.
Innovative work - Cloudera pushes the frontier of big data & distributed computing, as our track record shows. We work on high-profile open source projects, interacting daily with engineers at other exciting companies, speaking at meet-ups, etc.
Great culture - Transparent and open meritocracy. Everybody is always thinking of better ways to do things, and coming up with ideas that make a difference. We build our culture to be the best workplace in our careers.
*Experience - be part of the exhilarating ride at a fast-growing post-IPO startup
