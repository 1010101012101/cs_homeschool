# README

This repo is a collection of useful code snippets, learning projects, algorithms and data-structures in various languages I've written to teach myself how to code and improve my proficiency.  

The works inside this repository and any linked submodules are all released under the MIT license if unspecified, i.e. do what you want but don't expect support or a warranty.  In cases where it is unspecified but uses a GPL licensed dependency or is mis-licensed it will default to the underlying copyleft license if any.  

Some of the works within the repository such as `/learn_eth` may at times run on a GPL licensed platform but no assumptions are made on the execution environment and any libraries or direct linkages used for larger projects are MIT/Apache licensed.   

Code in this repository is strictly non-commercial and open-sourced as educational material.  

## Repo walkthru

- Interviews - Contains solutions for programming interviews, both pair-code and take home assignments.  

- learn_algos - Various algorithms and data structures implemented in various languages as learning tools.  

- learn_eth - umbrella repository for ethereum/blockchain/hyperledger learning projects. The EVM execution environment implementations are mostly GPL licensed but libraries like `ethersjs` which are used are MIT licensed.  Any code here should also run on a differently licensed implementation of the EVM and solidity on a more permissive licensed blockchain such as hyperledger and should be assumed to be targeting hyperledger.  

- learn_nn - Anything using jupyer notebooks/tensorflow/keras or other projects considered to fall under the umbrella of machine learning/AI goes here. Currently there's only instructions on recreating a deep_dream environment.
